gr8d4jm;redrocketinn;1;"# ""Aphria Inc. (NASDAQ:APHA) Short Interest Down 22.3% in February""

# DD:

A lot of analysts are changing rising their target prices of APHA and also either already considered it a ""buy"" or changed from a ""hold"" to a ""buy"". 

Short interest is down. I believe that's because hedge funds are exiting their short positions because they know something big is going to happen coming up. Either leading up to the merger date or on the merger date, and they don't want to be caught paying more than they have to when the price moons.

The shorts exiting also explains how the price got so low earlier this month and is lowering again today, possibly even lower. 

Two important dates:

April 12, voting on the merger takes place

On or about April 20, the merger is completed 

I would wait to see how low it gets today before buying in. It got as low as \~13 the last time Jpow spoke so it's worth waiting to see how low it can go so you can buy in. Regardless, if it stays around $20 ‚Äì $18, I personally would still buy in.

I believe APHA is going to moon after the voting confirms the merge, leading up to the merger date, or on or before the merger date. Either way something big is going to happen.

This is not financial advice.

gr75pdt;suggestiondude;3;"you think a stock is gonna rise, you buy a call option.

Prices vary, dates vary.

Ex- Buy GME $800 strike price call option ex March 19th, 2021. 

Expires this Friday is selling for $70 right now. 


If you think tomorrow GME is gonna rocket up from $200 to $801 you will be in the money. You will be able to sell that option for an insane amount. 

Even if GME gets to $600 you will have made a big profit if you sell that option otm.

Odds are tho, this doesn't happen, on Friday, your option, depending on broker will expire worthless.

If you want a longer $800 strike price option, say Nov 19th, 2021 you have a much better chance of it happening as the option has 8 months to hit that. That option right now is selling for $4500.

Puts are the opposite, betting on company to fail.

Long story short, options are a lot of gambling but can pay well if you get deep itm or close.

A lot of days I see a stock rocketing, I try and buy a few options with short expiration dates. Cost is cheaper and if they go on a tear can get in deep itm.

Right now I am buying APHA calls for April 16th, $25 strike, Its the day of merger and I think it will rocket that day if not at least one day in next 40 days. But def read up on options before buying, if a stock goes down, they can drop quick.";wallstreetbets;2021-03-17 03:02:15

https://www.tradingview.com/chart/?symbol=NYSE%3AGME

Open up trading view and play with the charts a bit.

Click on f(x) indicator and then enable some of the built in ones.

Best DD is the ones you do yourself and see with your own eyes. Use the DD to help guide you.

If you want to see the OBV (On-balance Volume) that some of DD here has been talking about you can compare GME OBV to another ticker like TSLA of AAPL.

You will see some something interesting.

Edit: Back on my computer now.

GME - On-balance Volume

https://www.tradingview.com/x/9yLEeJ3Y/

AMC - On-balance Volume

https://www.tradingview.com/x/3pHrcxuC/

APHA - On-balance Volume

https://www.tradingview.com/x/4WxQP15t/

RKT - On-balance Volume

BB - On-balance Volume

TSLA - On-balance Volume

Notice the difference?

Price dropping on GME doesn't flow volume flow.

$GME is an anomaly. Even compared to $RKT $AMC $ANAL

I've been in it since it was sub $10 and have taken some profits. Nothing HUGE because I wanted to see where it was going, but I'm kind of liking how things are looking pre-tlry merger. 

I know APHA likely doesn't NEED tlry from the way things look...but hear me out. I know big tobacco has been planning for this day to come. If these small companies want to survive and control market share once weed is legalized...they're really going to need as much capital and credit as they can get their hands on.

I foresee Apple-like lawsuits about everything from packaging to manufacturing processes to biological IP for cultivation and even plant genetics. The corn industry and tobacco are two prime examples of how big subsidized corps can drive out smaller companies.

This is one of the main reasons I'm personally interested in seeing the merger go through.

Steve Burns the CEO of Lordstown ran Workhorse for years. 

Workhorse has been estimating they will produce thousands of vehicles a year for the past few years. All told, they've produced 370 vehicles total in 5 years. I could go find all my research I've done on Workhorse, but I'm too tired of trying to point it out and then getting downvoted. Do your own research if you want.  I hope Lordstown does well, but if they follow in the footsteps of the CEO's old company, they will constantly over promise, and under-deliver.

On another note, it's fun to say shorts are stupid and yell at all the short reports. Hey, it's made us some dough. Nonetheless check the track record of the company doing the report. A ton of people always want to talk about how they attacked ""this one company he said was shit, then it boomed!"" but they ignore the dozen or more other companies they said were garbage and that then proceeded to be delisted, go bankrupt, or simply drop in price continually for years on end.   
Here is a list I made a day or two ago on another forum about this:  


 

Companies that are now Lower than when Hindenburg reported:

OPKO Nov 17 2017 - $7 then, Now $4.44

RIOT Dec 11, 2017 - $16 then, dropped to under $5 until Jan 21st of 2021. So 3 years of it being below the price at report.

MARA  Dec 13, 2017 - $20 then, dropped to under $6 within 6 months, wasn't  until Jan 1st 2021 that it was higher than the price at report. 3 years  later than when he reported.

PLSE  Apr 24, 2018 - $18 then, was under that until December of 2020. Now  higher. Over 2 years of being below his price at report.

INPX Apr 2018, - $17 then, now $1.23

GNPX May 2018 - $12, now $5.28

APHA Dec 2018 - $7 then, bumped up to $13 briefly, then was under $7 for 2 years. Now it's $24

EROS June 7 2019, -$3.30 then, now $2.02

SDC Oct 4 2019 -$14.72 then, now $11.84

HFFG March 23 2020 - $9.66 then, Now $8.34

SCWORX Apr 17 2020 - $7 Then, Now $2.11

GNUS June 5 2020 - $5.94 then, now $2.14

NKLA Sep 10 2020 -$42 then, now $17 LOOP Oct 13 2020 -$11.50 then, Now $8.50

KNDI Nov 30 2020 -$9.76 then, Now $7.08

Just a personal tip in case you are not already doing this, but i will look at OPs post history and then of course read the comments sections to see if their DD gets picked apart by reddit. And for that, i really love reddit compared to just investing in a stock based on something i heard on tv which has nobody critiquing it. The comments sections tend to be a good way to decide if a DD is worth following or not (although not in gamestops case. Everyone picked apart DFV for an entire year on his DD)
So since early November almost all the stocks i put on my watchlist because of DD i saw on reddit either took off or had small gains. The steel stocks are just starting to take off right now, they were like the only ones still in the red up until like a week ago.

gqruhkp;anonkraken;1;"Yes. Why? Catalysts. And I don‚Äôt give a fuck if they actually mean anything for revenue as bears have pointed out. This market runs on news... and weed is experiencing some historic news.

1) National Legalization: This is happening all over. We just had Mexico pass legislation and efforts are now moving in several big countries in Europe like Germany. Not to mention the Macdaddy bong rippers of all; the US. There will even be mini catalysts along the way as the legislation  passes various milestones in the process. TLRY/APHA have a presence in all of these markets.

2) State Legalization: States are legalization at a faster pace in non-conventional places. There‚Äôs nearly a 100% chance that NY, NM and MN will legalize in the coming months. Even if TLRY/APHA is a Canadian company and ‚Äúthere are US companies‚Äù as the bears say, it‚Äôs the biggest in the world, and it‚Äôs shares will gain from positive US news.

3) The merger: as mentioned, the APHA merger will make the combined group the largest weed company in the world. APHA owns Sweetwater Brewing out of GA and will leverage that massive distribution network to enter the US market quickly when the time comes. I think APHA/TLRY will be one of the last ones standing once the sector consolidates in a few years and smaller fish are eaten by big tobacco.";wallstreetbets;2021-03-13 05:29:52

gqq09r6;omg-i-die;1;The tax loss harvesting was a big revelation for me last month. My Roth has VTI and VXUS as the base, then a bit of ARKG/W and ICLN for a bit of long-term speculation, which I figured could easily be rebalanced as needed. But when I put in my $6k for this year I broke my plan and put 10% on weed just short of the top of that APHA spike. I have no idea what came over me, but I regretted it within hours. And who knows, maybe it will work out in the long run, but it really doesn‚Äôt fit with my plan and I definitely would use it for tax loss harvesting if it was in my taxable account. I also realized that even a small loss due to stupidity annoys me a lot more when it is an account where the contribution is finite.

gqpfumf;shad0wtig3r;1;"https://www.wsj.com/articles/aphria-and-tilray-to-merge-to-create-biggest-global-cannabis-company-11608137481

&gt;Two Canadian cannabis companies have agreed to merge, creating what they said would be the largest cannabis operation globally by revenue and potentially signaling more deals ahead among cannabis firms.

&gt;Aphria Inc. APHA -0.23% and Tilray Inc. TLRY -2.15% said Wednesday their proposed combination would create a company with annual revenue on a pro-forma basis of Canadian $874 million, equivalent to $686 million. The combined company would control 17% of the adult-use Canadian cannabis market by revenue, according to Raymond James, roughly double the shares of three other competitors.

It's close for sure, but at $686 MILLION it's widely reported they will be bigger via revenue period. Look MSOs have been lagging I'm in literally every MSO and other player with actual substance. But my gains on the Canadian players are WAY larger. 

And the merger will dominate attention for a long time. Biden hasn't done shit with decriminalization, he could have signed an EO on DAY ONE, and it's hurting MSOs as they need to get on major exchanges, until then they will not have the returns of the Canadian players.";stocks;2021-03-12 16:46:28

In Jan I had 1000% return on TLRY calls into BB. Lost half on assorted other gambles in Feb and hopefully will be back to $2k+ with APHA calls I purchased last week with expirys this Friday and next.

- Shareholders vote for merger in mid-April. If it gets approved then we‚Äôre most likely looking at May. 

- 100% correct on arbitrage; however, look at the options chain. There are FAR more options being traded on TLRY that is pushing the price up. Price discrepancy here can be viewed as the visual difference of the option interest / volume. 

- When it comes to mergers, option traders on the company that is merging into the other decreases (APHA). This is because there‚Äôs risk for call buyers holding through the date due to the Adjustments on existing contracts.";stocks;2021-03-12 02:49:56

09:46 AM EST, 03/10/2021 (MT Newswires) -- GameStop(GME) and AMC Entertainment(AMC) , both higher in Wednesday's early regular session, continue to lead mention counts among the WallStreetBets Reddit crowd, but EV stocks led by Tesla (TSLA) and Nio (NIO) are seeing significant herd momentum on the upside.

Tesla and Nio both popped at the open followed by gains in Li Auto(LI) , Xpeng(XPEV) and Plug Power(PLUG) .

Elsewhere, volume interest has been spiking in the cannabis category, with Aphria(APHA) , Tilray(TLRY) and Aurora Cannabis(ACB) recording a jump in average share volume over the last day.

ARK Innovation ETF (ARKK) is up about 1% early Wednesday after soaring more than 10% Tuesday.

Continue watching Palantir(PLTR) as its mention count and share volume interest has been growing.

Not to mention they suppy all of canada, not just a few states

Also they have an exclusive grow permit in Spain... opening doors to the European market and cutting costs on shipping.

They have an extraordinary position in the cannabis industry, you can check the merger details here @

Its guaranteed gains, just have to wait a little bit.

Remember post merger they become...

When something is on route to be the world's biggest, no matter what it is... and especially for 17$ a share... youre going to make money.

I know fuck all about options, and am not about to sell a covered call for 1/16 of the share price. I'm tryna learn, champ. I stand to make a front-end chunk of my initial investment back as premium, WITH a profit, selling that call, and if it gets assigned, they sell my 100 shares for a cool 100$. which is ASS money, but I'd still make a profit.

Sure your way might be ""forsure profit"" but the profit is so limited that the time spent on it wouldn't make any sense.

RKT is a nice company with solid fundamentals (I don't know what that means, so add air quotes) but I don't know if its a BLAST OFF TO THE MOONNNNN in X days kinda stock.  Buy in at $20ish and hold, it's so cheap, and you've probably thrown money away at worse garbage (lookin at you APHA, TLRY, SNDL, PLTR) so why not try investing in a company";wallstreetbets;2021-03-08 23:10:40
