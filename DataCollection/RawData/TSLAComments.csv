gr8bfmi;DogBearInuKuma;1;Risk tolerance and FOMO is difficult to manage sometimes. Helps to reason out and set yourself loss tolerance and gain goal and stick with it unless something significant in the world happens. Don't think of one big trade, but a series of many good trades. 10% gain is doing good so sell, 20% you're doing great so sell. Anything above that consider it luck and sell. If it goes higher after you sell don't regret, keep in mind what your goal was and that you achieved it and you're trying to make gains in the long run and not through luck. If you reinvest with 10% gain 3 times you're actually up 33% due to compounding interest. If you do it 8 times you've more than doubled your investment. Don't forget even with DD and fundamentals and even pop culture/trend pushing the stock along, one significant bad news and it'll drop. Just imagine what would happen to $TSLA if Elon died or became severely ill, or $COKE if news came out lead somehow got in millions of shipments. Happened to me with $EBIX.

gr7ymhr;geylang-angmoh;1;"Need some advice here.

I‚Äôm 24, have ~100k in savings, and ~3k monthly disposable income.

No debt, no assets, not even a proper citizenship - I‚Äôm from a country where human rights are a fairytale, and live in a place where I have little chances to naturalise.

I want to grow my savings as much as possible though I have relatively low risk tolerance. I might need to use this money in, say, 3-5 years for a house (best case), or as a rescue fund at any time if something goes wrong with my job or immigration situation (worst case).

As for the disposable component, I‚Äôm more comfortable with riskier options.

I have very little financial knowledge, and just a little bit of exposure to the markets as a long time lurker.

Now my worry is that most of the good companies I‚Äôve kept an eye on have grown to be overpriced, and even a no-brainer SPY looks like it‚Äôs about to start bleeding, all things considered. For example, I had TSLA on my watchlist since it was under $200 pre-split, and I didn‚Äôt buy.

Another problem is that I‚Äôm afraid of inflation. They printed so much money in the states, and the market is pumped, so this whole situation will just eat away my cash if I don‚Äôt do anything.

I think getting into stable dividend stocks with the savings, and DCA into a growth index or two with occasional risky purchases with the income would be a good play.

So, am I thinking in the right direction? What would be the best course of action for me?";investing;2021-03-17 09:39:52

gr74ul7;mailseth;1;"For what it's worth, people with quite a lot of experience in the market were watching RKT closely and still didn't cash out. Don't be too hard on yourself for not selling at the top. Instead be happy that you correctly found a stock that had the upside that it did. That's better than many people can claim.

As far as advice goes: buy stocks that you don't expect to sell for at least a year. After holding for over a year you only get hit with long-term capital gains tax, which is much cheaper than short term taxes. If you sell a stock after every bump, you might miss out on much larger gains in the future (and you get hit with higher taxes on your gains.)

For example, I sold my TSLA (after holding for years) at the top of the market a year ago at a 3x gain (\~$170 per share). Not bad, but if I had ridden out the dip for another 12 months I would have made at least an additional 4x on top of that.";stocks;2021-03-17 02:54:01

gr6yriv;Qs9bxNKZ;1;"It's not just ""how much is it valued at"" but ""compared to what?""

When you look at any individual stock, you should look at the position that stock has in the overall market (as as a retailer such as AAPL compared to Samsung).  

* How is the market position?
* What is the strength of the currency by which you'll be buying the stock?
* How does the overall market look?

It's a comparison, what your dollar can buy you versus the number of shares that AAPL you can acquire.  Look at your other stocks, and compare them that way - by ratios.  Look at the AAPL stock and compare it to the overall market.  Those give you two barometers that are price independent.  

1 AAPL or 1 WMT?  Now what if it were 10 AAPL for 1 WMT?  

1 AAPL or 1 VTI?  Again, what if it were 10 VTI for one share of AAPL?

Berkshire looks expensive now, but since there hasn't been a split ... same can be said about TSLA, but there has been a split (and it's still over $600/sh)

My AAPL position this past year is up to a bit over $50K, with an average buy-in price of $68.  I use WMT above) because my buy-in price there was $113, so two of WMT for one of AAPL back in 2020?

It is boring.  You won't care about how the market works, you won't be investing (directly) into TSLA or MSFT or AMZN.

We‚Äôre not openly coordinating shit. Some of us believe in long GameStop. Some see great day trading opportunities. Some think the stock will literally be bought for 100k per share. Some think there is no squeeze or if there was it squoze and all that‚Äôs left is a series of gamma squeezes.

So mr chairman, what do? If stock going to 100k then $800 a share is a frickin bargain. If squeeze squoze then it‚Äôs time to short. If gme has long potential what should its avg price be? If it‚Äôs just a volatility play, buy some near expiry options.

gr5q4ep;learn-and-earn-;0;"Franklin Templeton released a bunch of  thematic active ETFs in February 2020 &amp; March 2021. They seem pretty interesting, with a disruption/innovation theme to each of them. Matthew Moberg &amp; Joyce Lin are the fund managers.

All these ETFs have done very well in the recent past (but then again, 2020 was an exceptional year &amp; past performance doesn't imply future), but they have fallen quite a bit over the past 1 month, giving us potential entry points to ""buy the dip."" Here's my humble attempt at a summary:

[**Disruptive Commerce ETF $BUYZ**](https://www.franklintempleton.com/investor/investments-and-solutions/investment-options/etfs/portfolio/29096/franklin-disruptive-commerce-etf/BUYZ)**:**

1. Claims to invest in innovative companies benefitting from transformation in the e-commerce space
2. Claims to provide access to companies that are related to new online markets, streamlined procurement systems, and game-changing ways to deliver goods and services
3. Portfolio: large growth, where its top 5 holdings are popular ECommerce plays: $SE, $SHOP, $FVRR, $AMZN, $MELI, followed by interesting choices like $SQ, $PYPL, $DOCU, $UBER and $TDOC

[**Exponential Data ETF $XDAT:**](https://www.franklintempleton.com/investor/investments-and-solutions/investment-options/etfs/overview/30780/franklin-exponential-data-etf/XDAT)

1. Claims to invest in companies focused on or expected to benefit from the creation, collection, cleaning, analyzing, storage, securing, transport, selling, and/or use of data
2. Claims to provide access to companies that the investment manager believes benefit from or facilitate big data, data infrastructure, data analytics, and innovative use cases and applications of data which include artificial intelligence, augmented and virtual reality, software-as-a-service, personalized advertising and personalized healthcare among others
3. Portfolio: large growth, mainly tech as top holdings: $SNAP, $PINS, $FB, $GOOG, $TTD, $TWLO etc.
4. Performance: was formed only in January 2021, -2.71% YTD, -9.31% over the last 1 month
5. Expense Ratio: 0.50%

&amp;#x200B;

[**Genomic Advancements ETF $HELX**](https://www.franklintempleton.com/investor/investments-and-solutions/investment-options/etfs/overview/29097/franklin-genomic-advancements-etf/HELX)**:**

1. Claims to invest in innovative companies related to genomic-based technologies designed to enhance the quality of life
2. Claims to provide access to companies benefitting from or facilitating the use of new research including DNA sequencing, gene editing and personalized medicine
3. Portfolio: mid-cap growth, with top holdings: Intellia, Repligen, Wuxi Biologics, Illumina, Natera etc. Has an around \~38% overlap with the more famous $ARKG

1. Claims to invest in innovative companies furthering techniques that automate or enhance everyday tasks
2. Claims to provide access to companies that are developing technologies that support machine learning as well as those using automated processes
3. Portfolio: large growth, with interestingly diversified top holdings: $TSLA, $AAPL, $ISRG, $TSM, $AXON, $ADSK, $NVDA etc.
4. Performance: +137.14% over the past year, -0.36% YTD, -10.64% over the last 1 month

gr5f0t1;astheworldspins;1;"&gt; Nice strawman. I think you need to read Buffett‚Äôs 2012 letter to shareholders.

Your argument is that dividends create some kind of decay over time. They just don't. 

&gt; Companies like TSLA have reinvestment opportunities compared to the boring blue chip companies. If TSLA didn‚Äôt know what to do with the extra cash, then share buybacks or a dividend would be needed. I don‚Äôt quite understand what you‚Äôre getting at in this part.

You're assuming everyone wants to dump all their money into volatile stocks. In a bull market - they rock. When the bears come, your portfolio loses half its value (granted this is just unrealized value).

&gt; If you bought BRK, you would‚Äôve never paid taxes until you sold the stock. If you bought a bunch of dividend stocks you‚Äôd be paying taxes on all the dividends + when you sold the stock.

If you're generating revenue from your stocks you would need to sell in order to take money and reallocate or to use as income. You would be taxed then. If you don't need to sell your position to generate revenue, I don't see the argument here that buy and hold is the only solution. I have both. I have some that are growth and some that are dividend only and my goal is to generate monthly revenue so I can live off the income from this, and part of that is through dividends.

&gt; Well investing in only dividend stocks for the dividends compared to buying the index for the appreciation is quite different.

Again, you're assuming stocks that pay a dividend never appreciate. My years of holding MSFT and AAPL will beg to differ.

&gt; I don‚Äôt know if you‚Äôre a student or what, but the qualified dividend taxes start at $40k a year income. That‚Äôs not a high tax bracket, the median American is already in that tax bracket. Plus you don‚Äôt think a 15% will hurt your gains over the long term??

I am staring down retirement dude and have been investing for decades. Before I left my company as a C exec I was in a high tax bracket. I would gladly pay 15% in taxes instead of 30+ I had been paying before. You're going to get taxed no matter what. Taking capital gains and dividends taxes are less than what you pay taking a salary. This argument you're getting fucked by paying taxes is ridiculous. I am talking specifically non retirement funds as I can't put everything into those.";stocks;2021-03-16 18:25:26

gr5e1jo;canuckinfla;1;"Thanks for the great post. I personally think EVs are the future, but also think that EV is where tech was in the 90s. IMHO:

1. This is the crux, most EV companies will fold, or be acquired by more successful ones.  But the survivors will be giants. TSLA today could be MSFT in 2000, very successful, with a great future, yet wildly overvalued.
2. Agreed. However, if someone can figure out how to scale battery production (currently a bottleneck) then this goes far beyond cars. Electric buses, short range trucks (e.g. refuse truck, cement mixer, etc.) are much more attractive than cars.
3. In the short term tax credit are relevant. In the long term, however, the total cost of ownership for EVs are much lower. This is very attractive for fleet users. The higher capital cost is compensated by less maintenance, longer life, and cheaper energy. EVs have far fewer moving parts, more reliable engines, batteries that are already exceeding capacity. I wouldn't be surprised if EVs with 500k miles become the ""new normal"". And, while ICEs have reached technological maturity after a century of development, many key techs for EVs have lots of room for improvement.
4. Many countries are moving away from fossil fuels, in primis China and the USA. This is a multi decade long process, so I wouldn't focus on the current electric generation mix. And even EVs powered by gas plants are far cleaner than ICE cars, since in a power plant you can put much bulkier and more efficient equipment, and large and costly pollution control measures. The infrastructure is not a big issue (but the lack of willingness to invest in it is definitely an issue...). China has already shown how fast you can build the world largest power grid. We can incentivize charging EVs at night in order to smooth out the peaks, reducing the need for new infrastructure.
5. Agreed, this all comes down to political will. But I am not sure they need to built the infrastructure. After all, current car companies didn't built the infrastructure either.";investing;2021-03-16 18:18:08

I knew I had to bide my time and be patient. I asked myself ""What is the one thing Haupt loves the most?""

**WALLSTREETBETS!**

So I had devised the ultimate shitpost. One that would very change the course of WSB itself. I wasn't alone as many of us had noticed the shorting of GME. It was just too good to pass. Haupt would hate what would follow. Even having a subreddit of the ""OG"" days. It was all coming to plan. This was all to be known, like that of TSLA and his previous shitposting before him. Even if GME does age bad, I had taken WSB with it. It was me, all along.

See, this entire phenomena was all for Haupt91 himself. From start to finish. GME, the creation for OG WSB users. It was never about GME. It was all for Haupt to hate what followed. He would never get onboard with meme stocks ever. And GME, was the hook.

This was everything to him. And I knew how to change it. It was never about the money, diamond hands, or whatever was to follow. It is here. Now. The sheer autism that flows within all of us.

You, Haupt. You're the one who did this. You just HAD to shit on TSLA. You just couldn't follow a meme stock. Not once. Not once...

And now look what happened? Look at it Haupt. This is WSB now!

gr53dg2;The_Texidian;1;"&gt; If the idea that the dividend eroded value from the principle over time then my stocks, like the REITs, would be a fraction of what they were when I bought. In reality, they're all up.

Nice strawman. I think you need to read Buffett‚Äôs 2012 letter to shareholders. 

&gt; The blue chips that pay decent dividends - like 3-7% are not growth stocks so I wouldn't expect 100% gains from them yoy, but growth stocks don't generally pay dividends either and growth stocks can lose value quickly (TSLA e.g.). Those blue chip dividend stocks are boring and slow, but they don't drop 50% in value over some random tweet in the middle of the night neither.


Companies like TSLA have reinvestment opportunities compared to the boring blue chip companies. If TSLA didn‚Äôt know what to do with the extra cash, then share buybacks or a dividend would be needed. I don‚Äôt quite understand what you‚Äôre getting at in this part. 

&gt; The COST example is due to the special dividend they offer every few years and if you zoom out you will see COST grew around 30% in 6 months, along with a lot of the market. If you bought COST in 2018, you'd be up about 100% when that special dividend was announced as well as getting 7 dividends and 1 special dividend.

Right...market forces don‚Äôt cease because of an ex-dividend date. 

Imagine if you had $100 in stock X. Stock X plays a dividend of $1. On the ex date your investment is now worth $99. Market forces ‚Äúrecovers‚Äù the stock back to $100 and then you get the $1 dividend. You now have $101. 

Imagine if you had $100 in stock Y. Stock Y is basically the same company as stock x, but stock Y doesn‚Äôt pay a dividend. Your investment is worth $100 Market forces act and pushes the stock to to $101. You now have $101. 

&gt; People keep talking about index funds instead, but etfs also invest in dividend stocks and pay dividends. So I don't quite see the argument in favor if just looking at it from the dividend perspective, not to mention the etf fees. The only benefit is less exposure to individual stocks. They are a great way to invest if you don't want to take the time to manage your own stock portfolio.

Well investing in only dividend stocks for the dividends compared to buying the index for the appreciation is quite different. 

&gt; Taxes. I mean you're paying taxes on your income and unless you're in some high tax bracket, the tax rate is like 15% on qualified dividends. I'd rather pay 15% on money that was invested. I don't get the big argument about taxes and dividends.

If you bought BRK, you would‚Äôve never paid taxes until you sold the stock. If you bought a bunch of dividend stocks you‚Äôd be paying taxes on all the dividends + when you sold the stock. 

I don‚Äôt know if you‚Äôre a student or what, but the qualified dividend taxes start at $40k a year income. That‚Äôs not a high tax bracket, the median American is already in that tax bracket. Plus you don‚Äôt think a 15% will hurt your gains over the long term??";stocks;2021-03-16 16:59:51

gr4mbto;astheworldspins;1;"In a simple theory it works like this, but you will find in the markets stocks that pay a dividend aren't flat and often recover the difference and they're more closely pegged to market sentiment (and note, when I think dividend stocks I don't mean stocks that pay absurd dividends and are destined to go bankrupt, I mean stocks like AT&amp;T, VZ, MSFT, AAPL). If the idea that the dividend eroded value from the principle over time then my stocks, like the REITs, would be a fraction of what they were when I bought. In reality, they're all up.

The blue chips that pay decent dividends - like 3-7% are not growth stocks so I wouldn't expect 100% gains from them yoy, but growth stocks don't generally pay dividends either and growth stocks can lose value quickly (TSLA e.g.). Those blue chip dividend stocks are boring and slow, but they don't drop 50% in value over some random tweet in the middle of the night neither.

The COST example is due to the special dividend they offer every few years and if you zoom out you will see COST grew around 30% in 6 months, along with a lot of the market. If you bought COST in 2018, you'd be up about 100% when that special dividend was announced as well as getting 7 dividends and 1 special dividend.

People keep talking about index funds instead, but etfs also invest in dividend stocks and pay dividends. So I don't quite see the argument in favor if just looking at it from the dividend perspective, not to mention the etf fees. The only benefit is less exposure to individual stocks. They are a great way to invest if you don't want to take the time to manage your own stock portfolio.

Taxes. I mean you're paying taxes on your income and unless you're in some high tax bracket, the tax rate is like 15% on qualified dividends. I'd rather pay 15% on money that was invested. I don't get the big argument about taxes and dividends.";stocks;2021-03-16 14:52:58

Open up trading view and play with the charts a bit.

Click on f(x) indicator and then enable some of the built in ones.

Best DD is the ones you do yourself and see with your own eyes. Use the DD to help guide you.

If you want to see the OBV (On-balance Volume) that some of DD here has been talking about you can compare GME OBV to another ticker like TSLA of AAPL.

You will see some something interesting.

Edit: Back on my computer now.

TSLA is a stock that has explosive growth then would stay relative flat for a few years before the next leg up. Even a 5 year time horizon is not long enough. 

I have been all in the stock since 2015 ish and even the most hardcore Bulls were discouraged when the stock went down to $180 presplit ($38 now) in 2019. 

And even when the stock seems relatively flat, it's very volatile and 30% correction is quite common. 

So, the only recommendation is to hold it long term (like 10 years) and you will still sleep like a baby a night during the most recent 40% correction.";investing;2021-03-16 13:06:41

gr41quq;NoKids__3Money;1;I don‚Äôt know if about the other EV companies too much but you can‚Äôt compare TSLA to the rest of the car companies. When you look at a company like Ford or GM, you are actually only looking at a small slice of the total vehicle production universe. They get parts from hundreds (maybe thousands?) of suppliers, many in different countries, all they do is assemble it at their factory. Basically all they do is assemble your IKEA furniture for you and send you on your merry way whereas Tesla is much more vertically integrated on the production side (so they don‚Äôt have to share profits with suppliers), plus they actually make other high margin income from things like software up-sells, supercharging, premium connectivity, plus they don‚Äôt have the heavyweight of unions to deal with, plus they spend no money on advertising! How much do the other car companies waste on stupid super bowl commercials and whatnot. They also don‚Äôt have to deal with dealer networks sucking their margins dry. None of that includes what they‚Äôre doing with energy, solar, autonomy, etc. So when anyone compares Tesla to a traditional car company and says the relative market cap is too inflated I laugh and take the other side of their trade gladly.;investing;2021-03-16 11:41:24

(how realistic is it that other companies can snag up large portions of market shares in an industry that is dominated by companies that have been doing this for almost 100 years? we are not talking EV tech here. we are talking sales of automobiles, no matter the type of engine they are using)

anyways.   
if you decide to hold long term and maximize profts: 

buy in whenever. everytime the price drops 10% or more, buy more to average out.   
rinse, repeat. if prices continue to drop, get out. if the company offers good upside and growth, chance are you will come out ahead.

gr39g76;directionalbias;2;"Your assessment is good - it displays good fundamental analysis. 

The idea that EV's are a clean industry, apart from how the charging mechanisms will be implemented, is enough to at least pass a cursory review from most retail and even institutions that advertise an ESG flavor to their funds.  It makes people feel good to think they're doing something good for the environment.  Funds know this and they exploit this.  I know market players that use this moral compass in their trades.  

Cultish behavior - looking at you Technoking and TSLA.  They're a religion.  Good luck shorting a religion.  Society has been trying to do that for a few hundred years and it's still around.

Your typical day trader will appreciate the volatility and liquidity that some of these names offer.  A 5 - 10% swing intraday?  That's enough to entice some traders for sure.

There are some macro elements as well.  Long EV is effectively short fossil fuel.  I get it, that's not 100% true but the idea persists.  Who knows, that may be more true in the future with the proper technological advances.

Long foreign EV may offer an international exposure that a player wants.  I personally am long NIO mostly because I believe that China will have a much more stable supply chain to support their vehicles, battery, and charging model vs any other western EV company.  TSLA will compete obviously but don't underestimate a country with the will to become the best in class and the governmental and societal framework to brute force that desire.";investing;2021-03-16 04:24:27

gr2xte8;WiWiWiWiWiWi;1;"Question for people on fidelity... how do they handle option spreads on the day of expiration?  

Robinhood closes out all spreads on positions with any kind of volatility unless both legs are at least 5% ITM. And when they close them out they issue a market buy/sell order which is almost always filled well below/above the mark... they don‚Äôt even try a limit order at or near the mark. If you have limit orders to close pending, they‚Äôll cancel them. 

For example, the past two Fridays I had TSLA spreads with both legs ITM by more than $20. Both times Robinhood closed them for 1/2 the mark average... both times for almost exactly 40% of the spread value.  Not only were all my gains lost, by they closed them for less than I opened them, even though I opened them when they weren‚Äôt yet ITM.  

My $2.50 spreads were closed for $1.11 and my $5 spreads were closed for $2.31. 

A week‚Äôs worth of gains wiped out, plus a 15% loss on the original investment... for ITM spreads one hour before expiration!  I wonder which RH employee got to buy them from me without me having any say in the matter.  

60% lost in three minutes due to Robinhood‚Äôs bullshit... The immediate vertical drop on my chart was eye boggling when I opened it.  It looked just like GME did on Wednesday. 

That was a $10,000 mistake I won‚Äôt make again. I thought the first time was a fluke, but the second time showed it‚Äôs deliberate.  Fucking theft.";wallstreetbets;2021-03-16 02:29:14

gr2d2fd;spez_edits_thedonald;10;"put contracts are basically the reverse and give you the right to sell 100 shares at a specified price (strike price). 

so these are just instruments that do what they do, and people use them in different ways. Apes and retards use them to make insane bets that either burn their cash or explode into generational wealth. 

A more conventional use would be to use them as a sort of insurance policy. If you are sitting on 1000 TSLA shares, back when it hit $800, that is an $800,000 investment. Now let's say you get nervous that the price will tank, but you don't want to ditch your shares. You might buy a $700-strike put contract. You pay for the contract (similar to premiums when you buy insurance), but then if TSLA tanks to $500, you still get to sell your shares at $700, so you paid a premium to limit your potential losses. 

FYI: there is a lot more to learn about options before burning cash on them. You can bet a stonk will go up, buy a call, be correct, but still lose money (e.g. if volatility was high when you bought it and then goes down).";wallstreetbets;2021-03-15 23:12:22

Stock price fair value primarily correlates with all expected future cash flows (probability discounted to the present day), not past cash flows.

&gt; Your tesla TAMs are little more than a pipedream right now. 

Here's Piper Sandler's forward looking research report that is estimating $1,200 fair value for TSLA at the present day:

gr1xd0e;StockAstro;1;"I agree, I think TSLA will continue to decline for years to come. No one takes into this one simple fact; They have not yet had to act like a car company. Every car they sell has back orders, wait lists, they move the highest margin ones first. Well guess what? That stops soon. 

Next year we are going to start to see the wave of Lease returns. What the hell is TSLA going to do in 2024 when they have to take back 100,000 3 year old cars. They will be holding old inventory they will never be able to love. Logistics alone on storing 100s of thousands of leased vehicles is going to CRUSH TSLA. 

Once they start producing more cars then they actually sell (which eventually all major manufacturers do) their margins will shrink. As their margins shrink they will start to trade like a car company. 1X sales. 

I repeat by 2030 TSLA will be trading near 1X sales.";stocks;2021-03-15 20:35:08

gr1wnom;__TSLA__;0;"&gt;Comparing tsla to apple is ridiculous on so many levels.

I was comparing **Nokia** to Apple.

Comparing Tesla to Apple can be done, but it would be imperfect, because Tesla's target markets are ~30x larger than Apple's target markets.

So in many ways it's an apples to oranges comparison.

But yeah, we can think of Tesla as selling $40,000+ ""iPhones on wheels"", and scale everything up.

&gt;A more apt comparison from yesteryear might be Cisco..

CSCO is primarily active in the networking switch market, which is only $0.03t/year. Unfortunately they reached saturation in that market at around the year 2000, when the Internet bubble collapsed.

There's literally a factor of 1,000 difference between the size of the target markets Cisco and Tesla are growing into ... ü§¶

Tesla is still 10 years away from saturation, even at today's very high growth rate. You couldn't pick any worse comparison...";stocks;2021-03-15 20:29:48

VW. SPCE last year. Go dig in some past market charts, you'll find hundreds of spots where if you'd been able to see it coming, you could have made a killing.

GME is interesting. It's a lot of money changing hands. And maybe WSB, the old WSB, will be dead after this, and nobody who spots something like this coming will be able to make this kind of gains and bring the rest of us autists with them, since it's an absolutely insane 9.5 million subscribers and literally everyone has their bots and interns trawling us for more tips.

This is what I consider collusion to create bag holders of the less financially literate, but tbf the financial reporting can only come from company issued filings.

You‚Äôre right, meme stock values can defy conventional pricing estimates, but in the case of TSLA the extra capital generated helped them grow even faster rather than just pay debts. In the case of GME there was a legitimate squeeze happening as shorts had to cover. With AMC issuing shares there are more shares available to cover so the short interest as a percentage decreases drastically. Remember I had just discussed that financial reporting hasn‚Äôt updated shares outstanding to the number quoted on the earnings call?

GME, TSLA, etc. have shown that fundamentals matter less than investor sentiment, at least in the meme stocks.

I wrote an article on my top infrastructure stock for 2021 - it was ZEUS:

 

## The Fundamentals of Olympic Steel - My Level of Safety

Olympic Steel is a microcap with a market cap of only about $150M as of Feb 1st, 2021. The current stock price of $14 is still near its 5 year low. Here are my key metrics on Olympic Steel and why I like my margin of safety:

* Current assets of $395M and current Liabilities of only $96M, a current ratio over 4! Also a net current surplus of about $300M - with a market cap of only $150M!
* $233 of the current assets is in inventory as of Sept, 30th 2020. This inventory should be valued much higher with the surge in steel prices.
* Only $177M in Debt as of Sept, 30th 2020.
* So the net capital surplus minus the debt is over $120M.
* The net asset value of $24 a share, so its price to book is 50%.
* For Year-end 2019, produced over $120M of free cash flow. Almost the size of its current market capitalization!
* The last quarterly results in Sept. 2020 showed about $23M of free cash flow.

As stated at the beginning of this article, it is very hard to find ""value"" in today's market. Many firms are trading many multiples of book value - Olympic Steel trades at a ridiculous 50% of book.

## Recent Key Acquisition to Drive Olympic Steel Even Higher

On Dec. 14th, 2020 announced that it has acquired the assets of Action Stainless &amp; Alloys, Inc., the Company's fourth acquisition in the past three years. The all-cash purchase is **immediately accretive.** I like the word accretive!

Also, I like STLD in the steel space. TUSK would be a risky spec play, FSLR and TAN good solar plays, TSLA, GOEV, FSR my favorite EV plays...:";stocks;2021-03-15 13:34:20

gr0c23g;Energy_Solutions_P;1;"My take as an Energy economist:

Yes oil demand has not yet recovered from COVID.

I think we will see ""peak"" oil demand soon - maybe 2023-2025 - much sooner than the markets are predicting.

The EV revolution is real - in a few years, we will have enough EV's on the road to start to move oil demand to a decline.

The above effect will favor solar, wind, energy storage, and natural gas.

Investor takeaways: Stay with O&amp;G firms that make most of their $$ from NG. TSLA, FSLR, CSIQ, TAN, etc should be winners...

gqzpvpr;jeff_varszegi;1;"The fees on most ETFs are so low that I don't see value in this--that is, I agree with your result. I think you'd lose tons of efficiency over time in the inability to rebalance properly due to granularity effects at low share numbers per underlying holding, plus it'd be a real pain in the butt to do manually and you'd kick off tons of taxable events in a taxable account. 

You know what I do see value in, though? Analyzing holdings from strongly performing ETFs for long-term buy-and-hold investing, then buying the underlying holdings that fit your strategy. That way you can pick the best of the best while avoiding overlap. 

This is particularly relevant with the current massively overweight megacaps like TSLA, which I'm avoiding like the plague.

Tech investment isn't about competition over a current product and market to be valued per their share of the market today.Tech is about creating and participating in new market domains that wholely or partially aren't even present yet.

Take the most talked about tech ticker of the days TSLA. Was there a large scale EV market before TESLA? No. There is now though, and now the talk is all about ""they are going down because VW etc"". They will have competition in the EV market sure, but TSLA is focusing on autonomous driving now and this is bound to create new market domains.
Who's to know how much these will be worth and by when exactly? How do the critics apply something that isn't even fully shaped yet to valuation predictions? They don't.

It is funded by a tiny portion of TSLA gains on Tue/Wed so I'm not concerned the slightest... actually this entire selection is funded by a part of the gains from 1 of my 620c contracts, so I thought I should try and go hard this week in case the rebound rally continues.

I agree about BA. But what I've noticed is after every big bump up in the last year, it takes a dip. It's a chance to grab a bit on the premium. However if it stays green tomorrow, I have no question I will dump it asap, and try the play again maybe Tue or Wed.

Basically everything I will decide at open if I hold, or sell and try to time it better. It basically depends if solar, ev, and oil are green in pre-market, and how much. The contracts on semiconductor and bank ETFs I will likely hold, trusting continued momentum through the week. If it continues up enough, I may just exercise and hold a bit longer.

TSLA, yeah, always a heart pounder. If it's red in pre-market I'll dump it quick at open, and revisit the ticker and look for an opportunity. If it's up a nice bit, I'll likely sell it at open, because I have another call in my ""casino account"" on TSLA and will let that ride in case it gets to 725+

Wonder how you felt about TSLA when the media was running tons of smear/FUD campaigns early pandemic while TSLA shortsellers were getting their asses kicked. Or if you were even paying attention back then...

Before GME, TSLA was pretty much the most heavily shorted stock. Those buybacks for sure caused price jumps, and without shareholder selloffs, none of the dips remained dipped. Just how it happened, man.

'Fundamentals' are about as relevant as technical indicators in today's market. Doesn't matter why people like the stock, or why they buy it. It's each investors right to purchase whatever security they want, for just about any reason.

gqxsge7;reaper527;1;"don't forget that ""options"" is an INCREDIBLY broad term with many different levels to it.

you can absolutely make huge gains with normal shares and without touching options. (just look how much money someone would have now if they put $5k into TSLA in early 2020). it's just harder to make big gains, ESPECIALLY if you don't have a ton of capital to put into a company that you think might double or 3x in a couple years.

i was EXTREMELY confident disney was going to skyrocket from the $90/share it was going for a year ago, but it's not like i could simply say ""ok, i'm going to put $200k into this and next year my money will double and i'll have $200k of profit"". 

think of it this way, there's a big difference between a 100% rate of return on $1k than there is on $100k. it takes money to make money. now don't be discouraged by that, because with compounding growth, shares are going to grow over time and you'll typically end up with much more than you put in, it's just  not necessarily ""get quick rich and retire in 2-3 years"" for most people with normal income/savings.

on simple options (covered calls, possibly some puts), there's a lot of capability for someone to take their holdings and enhance those gains. you're not doing anything high risk like some option strategies, you're just saying ""hey, i'll take $100 from you now, and if these 100 shares that i paid $35 for go up over $50, i'll sell them for $50 no matter what they cost. you win either way because either it doesn't strike and you keep the premium, or it does strike and you made a profit on your investment.

if the idea of options make you uncomfortable, just ignore them and pretend they don't exist. you can make a solid return without them just from share growth and dividend payouts. if you do want to experiment with them, there's nothing wrong with going slow at first. 

i created my first portfolio last march, did my first options trades (covered calls) around the 4 or 5 month mark (july/august), and then now that i'm more comfortable with them i'm starting to get into puts.";stocks;2021-03-14 20:23:41

Case in point if you're willing to keep reading. During the meteoric rise of TSLA (during November, I believe) before they became part of the S&amp;P, Musk promised a vehicle he had previous denied even existing; in fact, he had spoken out against making the vehicle -- which resembled something more than an SUV but less than a truck. He had to promise the stars of only to get his stock price to the moon (#NoOneLeftBehind). This is what businessmen like to do and Musk is not even the 100th person to do it.

Granted, one day...Lord knows when that might be...the Level 5 will be so commonplace and effective that this situation will be moot, but technology only gets better as we can generate the capacity for it and production of it.

If your friend feels cheated, so were we all when we were young and bought ""experimental"" doo-dads and whatnots because we were ""promised"" an expectation that inevitably fell short. Musk should be held accountable, as any manufacturer should be, but that fine print is tricky. The lawyers get ahold of products ling before the FDA, DOT, or any of their ilk do. There is some clause somewhere in the microscopic inking that says ""Buyer beware"" but no one can read 6 pt, even on a 4k res screen.

gqx4lyb;wokeinthematrix;1;"I kind of feel like I might be better off investing in more stable long-term stocks, like DIS (which I believe will grow, as Disney is already huge and very likely to continue buying other companies like they bought Fox), TSLA, AAPL, 5G stocks (which will SUPPOSEDLY blow up this year or next year), etc.

But, realizing that GME could have FINALLY freed me to not only start my own life, and not only make up fir 25 years of missing out and misery, but I could live BEYOND my dreams.

I could literally have $483,000 (more or less) RIGHT NOW, which would definitely afford my healthcare next year (I turn 26 at the end of the year), I could get away from all of these right-wing extremists, I could avoid having to work away the rest of my 20s (I am so far behind the only way I can catch up otherwise is probably working another job over 40 hours a week, somehow going to school fulltime too, and likely paying for therapy more than once a month, which is all insurance will pay for) and barely even have time to sleep (which I struggle with even when I DO have time, I just can‚Äôt fall asleep early at night).

The idea of putting my stimulus and tax return (a total of over $2,300) into more secure long-term stocks definitely seems promising for years or decades down the road, but it‚Äôs depressing as f*ck, because I see myself being miserable and lonely, either overworking a terrible job, or even being homeless until I get big returns.

If I wasn‚Äôt ready to immediately move out so I could plan that better, I could at least pay my parents more rent to help them out better (they have their own debts).

I was ready to throw my stimulus and tax return into CLVS and PGEN, as these are SUPPOSEDLY the next short squeezes, but I‚Äôm not sure that will happen. And supposedly Jack in the Box and Chili‚Äôs.

I‚Äôm also planning on investing in weed stocks as the US is legalizing marijuana, I support this (although don‚Äôt personally smoke, as I take medication that would have dangerous reactions like serotonin syndrome) and think it‚Äôs safe to say that these companies will blow up, and a lot of these stocks are only like $0.30 a share right now. Also mushroom and psychedelic stocks (microdosing is already legal).

If I made all that money from GME I could afford to invest in the short-term AND long-term, AND live it up RIGHT NOW, but I can‚Äôt go back in time, so trying to find the next play.

My money is definitely not growing just sitting in a savings account though. I‚Äôm not going to take it ALL out, but I might take some extra in addition to my stimulus and tax return.

I‚Äôm 25, I don‚Äôt want to be poor and/or have to tightly budget until I‚Äôm an old man. Especially if that means I have to spend my life in either a dangerous part of a city or a small town/rural area (NEVER AGAIN!)

I just want my independence and security, and I want it now, and, at least to some extent, kind of need it before the year is over.....

I just want to enjoy the game of Life. I don‚Äôt want kids, so that‚Äôs a responsibility I won‚Äôt have, but I would like to be with women (which is easier when not poor/broke)

That‚Äôs the best I can explain it.

But I bought GME Jan 12 @ $20 not because of the squeeze, but bc Ryan Cohen joined the board and the growth potential of the company became too attractive not to buy. I fully believed the company would be able to turn itself around and hit $5 Billion market cap in the short term, with the potential to hit \~ $50 B over the next 5 years. That's not unrealistic if they start hitting their numbers, and that's still only 1/16th the size of Tesla.

Also, many people would challenge your statement that Tesla has any business value, so from my perspective, the comparison remains apt.

I don't really see GME hitting $800 Billion market cap, so I guess they aren't the exact same, but I'm speaking from the view of a shareholder who wants the value of their shares to increase as much as possible. Starting at a value of \~$400 Million to even just $5 Billion is absolutely unreal gains, that's not where we're at now but I believe that severe mispricing was the same situation with TSLA back in the day when it was being shorted to oblivion.

Sure - there are arguments as to why this may not happen, but ultimately the higher you bid up the price of an asset, the lower the long term return you will get. There is nothing you can do to change that equation.

So it becomes a question of whether the current situation is sustainable, even with fed continuing a monetary policy designed to keep prices in a bubble. I‚Äôm sure we will have further peaks and gains before we crash - and predicting the top is impossible.

gqw60rj;akokaz1;1;"Last week saw some recovery for the hard hit tech and growth stocks as investors became slightly more comfortable with inflation forecasts, meaning US bond yields tapered off, which raised stock prices *(they essentially have an inverse relationship, as one rises, the other drops).* In addition, the $1.9 trillion stimulus bill was completed by the US govt.

For some, reduced stock prices provided a buying opportunity, or at least an opportunity to average down the cost of some of the positions.

I don‚Äôt expect us to be fully out of the woods yet in terms or recovery, with monday market opening likely to be red all over, as late on friday, bond yields jumped again following low demand for US govt bonds in auction *(when you take into account inflation, the yields on those bonds means you essentially have less money value than what you invested),* however, that should reduce by end of the week.

Still bullish

Taking a step back and Looking at the overall market, this correction was not just healthy, but overdue. While some assets are still overpriced, overall economy recovery provide a good backdrop for further mark growth, at least in the short-medium term. This current period provides an opportunity to *‚Äúbuy the dip‚Äú* on stocks which have a solid future, but also to reap the gain from some sectors that will see rapid growth over the next year. After all, rising inflation forecasts are due to the fact that most economists see the world economies recovering rapidly from the return of normality from COVID.

What will be the recovering sectors?

In short, think of any the stocks that you have not been able to use or shop from over the last year.

Buzzing stocks this week

I have created an algorithm that tracks chatter on social media to identify which stocks are trending, by measuring the shift in mentions this week compared to previous week. Meme stocks are purposely filtered out here.

The full results can be found here: [https://buzzingstocks.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/March+Stocks+2-01.png](https://buzzingstocks.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/March+Stocks+2-01.png)

Here‚Äôs my commentary on the most interesting ones in there:

* **3D Systems, ticker: DDD**  
Since the time of writing and creating this graph, this stock has shot up **%4.2** and up another **%1.5** in pre-market. Down from All-time high from earlier this year, DDD benefitted from analyst upgrades last week, as its price suffered a big tumble. Furthermore, ARK initiated DDD position in ARKQ (Autonomous Technology &amp; Robotics) ETF yesterday, putting it in the same basket as TSLA. Expect further gains short-term, and high volatility.
* **Accsys Technologies, ticker: AXS**  
This is a very interesting one, especially long-term. A sustainable wood company that produces high technology, alloy-like wood, planting a tree for every one it chops down. Has recently completed the building of 2 large production factories. I might even cover this on a separate article. ***Note:*** *This company has a small market cap, meaning a low number of shares traded, which means it could take longer than you‚Äôd like to buy/sell your shares.*
* **Vermilion Energy Inc, ticker: VET**  
Saw a price jump as analysts upgraded its price target last week. Energy companies are rising as demand is forecast to increase over the next few months. Not sure how this one will move in the near-future, one to watch.
* **Teradyne, ticker: TER**  
Another one seeing lots of chatter on the back of ARK positioning. This one is a very exciting prospect to me, and ticks A LOT of boxes, most importantly, very solid finances. The company saw Earnings per share *(total earnings of the company, divided by number of shares, the higher the better)* growth of 64% last year.

Summary

Expect a less wild ride next week than the last few weeks, but still with some turbulence. Reduced prices have created a number of opportunities, which are being picked up by the algorithm.

While there is likely still some downside in the market, longer-term I see a rosier picture, especially as economies recover and return to normality. I see now as an opportunity to purchase some opportunities at strategic prices, as well as a time to rotate into some of the recovery stocks, taking some profits from the growth/tech sectors along the way.

and yes: GME

for the evolution of their stock price. I‚Äôm not saying these are ‚Äòproper‚Äô valuations, the market was ‚Äòright‚Äô, it makes sense or it is sane, I‚Äôm saying these companies, among many others, have seen their stock price go up considerably in the last two years which means that, when you joined them at the right time it was possible to make a very great deal of money.

The multiplier effect of a double up is ferociously effective. Start with $1000 bucks, 10 double ups (I‚Äôm not remotely suggesting this would be easy) and you‚Äôre over $ 1 million. There is power in those numbers. Scrape together $1000 (and I‚Äôm aware that a lot of people don‚Äôt get that opportunity), make the right decisions (again, not self-evident), a million bucks makes a difference in someone‚Äôs life.

I‚Äôm wondering how many people who get that $1400 check will see it for the opportunity it is and make the right choices.";wallstreetbets;2021-03-13 23:52:35

gqui6ve;wokeinthematrix;1;"I kind of feel like I might be better off investing in more stable long-term stocks, like DIS (which I believe will grow, as Disney is already huge and very likely to continue buying other companies like they bought Fox), TSLA, AAPL, 5G stocks (which will SUPPOSEDLY blow up this year or next year), etc.

But, realizing that GME could have FINALLY freed me to not only start my own life, and not only make up fir 25 years of missing out and misery, but I could live BEYOND my dreams.

I could literally have $483,000 (more or less) RIGHT NOW, which would definitely afford my healthcare next year (I turn 26 at the end of the year), I could get away from all of these right-wing extremists, I could avoid having to work away the rest of my 20s (I am so far behind the only way I can catch up otherwise is probably working another job over 40 hours a week, somehow going to school fulltime too, and likely paying for therapy more than once a month, which is all insurance will pay for) and barely even have time to sleep (which I struggle with even when I DO have time, I just can‚Äôt fall asleep early at night).

The idea of putting my stimulus and tax return (a total of over $2,300) into more secure long-term stocks definitely seems promising for years or decades down the road, but it‚Äôs depressing as f*ck, because I see myself being miserable and lonely, either overworking a terrible job, or even being homeless until I get big returns.

If I wasn‚Äôt ready to immediately move out so I could plan them better, I could at least pay my parents more rent to help them out better (they have their own debts).

I was ready to throw my stimulus and tax return into CLVS, NAKD (only $1 a share!), and PGEN, as these are SUPPOSEDLY the next short squeezes, but I‚Äôm not sure that will happen.

My money is definitely not growing just sitting in a savings account though. I‚Äôm not going to take it ALL out, but I might take some extra in addition to my stimulus and tax return.

I‚Äôm 25, I don‚Äôt want to be poor and/or have to tightly budget until I‚Äôm an old man. Especially if that means I have to spend my life in either a dangerous part of a city or a small town/rural area (NEVER AGAIN!)

I just want my independence and security, and I want it now, and, at least to some extent, kind of need it before the year is over.....

I just want to enjoy the game of Life. I don‚Äôt want kids, so that‚Äôs a responsibility I won‚Äôt have, but I would like to be with women (which is easier when not poor/broke)

They are extremely high-risk, extremely high-reward, but if you‚Äôre one of the lucky ones, you‚Äôll get a return far greater than even 20 years of solid investing. Of course, you‚Äôll still make money doing 20 years of solid investing, but it‚Äôs not quite the same.

IMO a big reason that retail investors go big in on the TSLA/GME plays is specifically because they don‚Äôt necessarily have the principal to create decent compounding for a long time.

If you have $10k in the market, 8% yearly gains is $800. Sure, that will compound over time and in 10 years your $10k will have grown to a total value of $22k.

Tesla isn't just a conventional automaker.  Tesla will get a position like Google, as data from autonomous driving will be collected, exploited and sold over the past and next few years.  The other automakers will not start from scratch to collect informational data here for you.

 I am sure that Tesla will be the most valuable company in the world in the next 5 years.

 Ark invest continues to buy regularly for a reason.

 If you continue to compare Tesla with BMW, VW and Co., then you have not understood Tesla.

 The robotaxi market alone is worth US $ 5 trillion!

 So Tesla will not have overproduced cars in the future either, because these will go straight to the robotaxi market.

 Bus and train (short distances) will soon be superfluous.  So Tesla will soon be displacing not only taxis and public transport, but also Uber.  So digitization is going to be digitized.

 The question shouldn't be ‚Äúif‚Äù but ‚Äúwhen‚Äù ?!

 My portfolio consists of 20% Tesla which is quite a lot.  I've been with it since 2017 and I'm still buying more.

 While most ignorantly compare Tesla with a normal automaker, the $ TSLA pulls you by cheaply.

 At Tesla you have everything: money, top management (and exceptional leadership), the crowd (almost a fan base more than Apple) and of course great products!

Yes there are regional cost differences and overall I didn't say TSLA wasn't cheaper... I literally did, but I said it was basically the same overall cost if you avg it out.

gqr8dc6;Pass_Little;1;"So here's  what I do for 90+% of my portfolio:

I don't research any stocks, just go buy a widely held index fund.   See r/bogleheads or [https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Getting\_started](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Getting_started) lots of deep insight into why this on average, will beat most active funds.   In other words:  I researched a long-term investment strategy that is proven to work instead of doing the work of trying to pick individual stocks.   

One data point about the statement above.   The most recent [SP Global report](https://www.spglobal.com/spdji/en/spiva/#/reports) for 2020 showed that just over 75% of funds underperformed the S&amp;P 500 index.  This means that the majority of the most highly paid and valuable fund managers don't succeed in beating the market.  So I don't see why I should feel like I can beat the performance of people who do this for a living.

Now, note I said 90%,  There is 10% of my portfolio I invest in things which I believe in long-term or that makes me happy to own a piece of or that reflects a trend I'm seeing and I want to invest a tiny bit in.   

Some examples:

I bought a couple of shares of  TSLA like 2-3 years ago when it was 1/10th of the price it is now (pre-split, so I now have 10 shares).   I bought it because I don't think anyone should bet against Elon Musk, and I think that TSLA will survive long into the future.  

I have a bit of DAL (Delta Airlines) during the covid dip because I am a big fan of the way they treat their customers as opposed to the other 2 big US airlines, and I couldn't pass up getting some of their stock on sale.

I have a couple of shares each of a few thematic ETFs that I find intriguing such as IPO, BUZZ, and SFYF.   Or ones that make my inner geek happy such as ROKT.    And I have (or more accurately trying to reduce my position to) 1 share each of the ARK funds.

I also have a few individual shares of companies that haven't fully recovered from COVID yet, but I would expect to like cruise companies and the like.

Note that all of the holdings in this 10% of my portfolio I consider to be a 'gambling' portfolio.   If any of them go to zero, I'm not going to care.   Well, I'll care, but it won't be the end of the world.   But I don't rely on it for my retirement.";stocks;2021-03-13 01:38:20

gqqvwc0;darkforcesjedi;1;"If you made a net profit of $20, you will owe taxes on that.For US federal taxes,  short term (on assets/positions held less than a calendar year) gains are taxed as ordinary income. Long term gains are taxed at your capital gains rate.

Losses on other capital transactions can be used to offset up to the full amount of your capital gains. (If you realize $1M profit on GME, and $1.2M loss on TSLA in the same calendar year, the TSLA loss offsets the GME gain and you wouldn't owe tax on it.) Excess losses can be carried forward into future tax years to offset capital gains and a small amount (up to $3000 per year) can be used to offset ordinary income.

gqqroum;cwdawg15;1;"Be careful with the term growth, in this case.

It seems like what you really mean is Large-cap and in particular, 'mega-cap.'

The problem is companies rise and fall over decades or a century. You're right. You do need to keep evaluating and looking at what is going on and know when to get out and when to stay in.

The problem is these large-caps have market power -**now**\-. They can usually safely make more money for the time being, so I definitely would not ignore them. You can own AAPL for a decade or more, while it is going great, and slowly down-size how much you own and put money into the next large-cap companies that grow over the years.

The small and mid cap companies are a combination of companies that are falling, are rising to the next big thing unknown to everyone, are rising and will never make it, and just simply won't make it.

The problem is it is a gamble to find the right ones. You can find the next big thing, but you bought 20 other companies that weren't trying to find it.

&amp;#x200B;

I usually recommend people to not forget the Russel 2000 or the S&amp;P 400, but the S&amp;P 500 has been doing better the last couple of decades.

If you invest in ETFs that track an index, always remember as companies rise and fall they are added to or removed from the indexes. So if you stay in the index funds, someone is already increasing or decreasing positions in a company as they rise and fall for you.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Growth vs. value is not about company size. It is more about the companies goals and how it operates in a market.

A growth company is investing into their product or new products. They have a clear path to growing and making more revenue in the future.

The company will have lower or no dividends. Typically, they are priced higher than the revenue they get. You will often see P/E ratios of 30 and up (price/earnings per share).

AAPL in the past decade is a good example of this. They are still investing heavily in R&amp;D and trying to make better and new products fairly rapidly over the decade. Their dividend is below 0.7% and they have a P/E ratio of 33. It could be argued that APPL is starting to mature right now.

TSLA would be a high-growth company far from maturity, that is expensive vs. revenue. There is no dividend and the P/E ratio is extremely high of $140 (12 month trailing PE $900+). There is no dividend, but rapid stock price growth.  The company is creating a new innovative product. Investors are paying a large premium for a company that is not making the revenues to justify the price.... yet. They are paying for future potential.

The stock is usually priced for the company to be larger and produce more revenue in the future.

&amp;#x200B;

A value company is a mature company that doesn't have much room to grow revenue or create new innovative products. They are still trying to cut costs, create new brands or enhancements, etc.. However, the market is saturated. It might grow slowly as there are more people in this world.

These companies usually have a dividend, which can often surpass 2% annually. The P/E ratio is usually lower, but it can get a little bit higher as the dividend increases.

One example of Coca-Cola. It is a large company. It is not in a rapid growth industry of a technology. They sell soft drinks and the market is saturated. People still buy them and there is some shifts in flavors and the world's population is growing.  They are not reinvesting much money in new products. You don't expect to see huge gains in stock price, but investors often get more dividends from the revenue they make.

There dividend is 3.3% with a P/E ratio of $23. Stock investors are not putting as much money into the stock for future growth in company size, rather they are investing for what returns they can get out it through dividends -and- slow market growth the company.

AT&amp;T is a great example. It is a technology becoming less important and there is less room for them to grow, but it is a regulated product. They own a chunk of limited airwaves and they own a system of wires to people's homes and are semi-protected from some competition.

It is expensive to maintain, but they have some pricing power over the consumer. The P/E is close to $9.

She encapsulates the mindset of the tech valuation bubble perfectly, and as long as this bull market will continue, ARK will do fine. Because they believe the hype. Because that is their whole idea, it's about disruption, revolutionary tech, new stuff that makes the old stuff look antiquated.

I don't doubt your professional opinion at all, in fact I'm more than ready to believe a random internet stranger telling me he knows better about this stuff than Cathie does. It just doesn't matter all that much right now, because the market simply does not care. As long as TSLA has the valuation it has right now, the market does not care about the now, it cares about the best possible future in 20 years, when every car is electric and autonomous driving is the standard and cancer can be cured with CRSPR or something. Is it a bubble? Sure. Should a conservative investor put money in ARK funds? Definitely not. But none of this is news, as long as money is cheap and the central banks keep buying bonds at such a high level to control the interest rates there is a plausible case to be made that this bull market is not at its peak yet.";stocks;2021-03-12 22:34:30

gqqbwfa;ionized_fallout;-2;"03:47 PM EST, 03/12/2021 (MT Newswires) -- AMC Entertainment Holdings(AMC) was the most active among the most cited stocks on Reddit's wallstreetbets on Friday, with shares jumping 9% in afternoon trading on slightly lower volume.

The movie theater company, which has been under considerable financial pressure during the pandemic, released better-than-expected quarterly earnings on Wednesday. AMC also revealed it has now reopened 527 of its 589 US theaters.

Shares of GameStop(GME) , which has served as the center of the wallstreetbest universe for the last several weeks, were up 6% in late day trading on slightly lower volume.

Palantir (PLTR) , which has also been in play for some time on the subreddit, was trading largely flat. Volume was down from 86 million shares on Thursday to 50 million on Friday.

Forum regular Tesla (TSLA) saw its shares slip 2%, while BlackBerry (BB) shares climbed 9%.

Cannabis producer Aphria(APHA) was also back on Reddit radar screens Friday, with shares gaining 3%. Also attracting attention was Chinese EV maker Nio (NIO), with shares dipping 2%.

Elsewhere in the broader market, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 1% and the Nasdaq Composite Index eased 0.6%, while the S&amp;P 500 hugged the flatline.

gqpl59n;brokemember;1;"No they are not. But both tsla and gme were indeed -- and still are -- one of the most heavily shorted companies.

I never suggested all they are the same (or all shorted ones are worthy of even looking at)...my point being valuation based on  fundamentals left the market a long time ago.

One could argues TSLA future prospects are in bigger danger than gme with all the new competitors in the EV market. They have the first mover advantage and technology...but it's only a matter of time that other cheaper EV makers achieve that too (consider what happened to car manufactures when Toyota and Honda decided to go from nothing to eventually taking over).

I personally think tsla is way over price and the price will come down -- whether that's going to be tomorrow or 3-years from now, is something I don't know.

gqpap4f;Upper-Director-38;1;"Having said that, I've done this before in different wording. I bought low into a company at 12, they skyrocketed to 30 and my EoY goal when I bought was 24, So I sold a chunk at 30, they plummeted back down to 17 I bought at 17, they went back up to 21, I thought this was a false bounce because they had just been trading at 30 so I sold a good chunk at 21, they went back down to 14 I bought at 14 then they went back up. That is far from the usual way it goes. I got really lucky. I could have been wrong on any of those calls and it would have cost me potential gain. I've done it before And been wrong on those calls. I still made money I just left some on the table...biggest one that comes to mind was TSLA, I bought 4ish years ago, doubled my money, said I'll buy the dip and...well we see how much money I left on the table. On the other hand I've also Not done it when I knew I should bought in at 4 went to 10 thought it was gonna hit 15, now its back to 4. But that type of thing is why, now, I go into every short term investment with goals and sell points. But at no point do you ever ""Know"" it's going to hit 20 then go to 15 then back to 20. It could go to 20 and then you sell and it hits 40, or in my worst case scenario case 880. No garuntee.   


Long term investments dont matter, I buy once a month and if its high I buy less if its low I buy more. There's nothing to time nothing to sell just keep plodding along until I hit an age where I need to adjust my risk level.";stocks;2021-03-12 16:08:19

This is very much a bull market and a lot of it is driven by new participants but also disruptive companies like a TSLA or PLTR or DKNG that have young investors genuinely excited. Even GameStop‚ÄîI came for the squeeze‚Äîbut I‚Äôve stayed because I‚Äôm a gamer and I know there‚Äôs a vacuum between the massive ecosystem of gamers and streamers and the mainstream that needs to be filled and I know RC sits on their board and I saw what he did with Chewy. Sure, could be too little too late, but why not take a flyer on it? If nothing else, the fundamental forces at play for GME have inspired me to begin looking at another company rumored to be aggressively going digital now, and I can think of other real-time case studies that my friends and I are all considering when deciding to buy shares in a company. 

The beauty of this market is that information is plentiful and there are still plenty of safe companies out there with strong dividends that can be used to backstop a portfolio so we can feel comfortable betting on the riskier plays. There are plenty of value traps, sure, but also plenty of no brainers to balance it out.

gqo4m47;hogman12;1;"I'll do my best to answer your question, but I didn't intend to make the point that you've implied I have. Pricing power will protect levels of demand at changes in price. To my knowledge, pricing power is not protected against changes in the levels of demand. If demand decreases as a result of losses in buying power caused by inflation, then having pricing power could still be advantageous but the degree to which that translates into a competitive advantage will be reduced exponentially as inflation increases.

There's no way that any single answer to these questions would be correct across all scenarios. I appreciate that you're Interested enough in the subject to present a question as if there is a single correct response. However, and with all due respect, I think it's naive not to acknowledge that it could be either, neither, or both somewhat interactively depending on a multitude of other factors. For example was a relatively high percentage of money invested on the speculation of huge potential for future value such as with TSLA now or Amazon 10-20 years ago? Or was a relatively high percentage invested with the expectation of continued steady growth as with Walmart in the 2000s until fairly recently? Maybe that wouldn't matter so long as there's money circulating, but shouldn't we at least acknowledge there could be other factors to consider?

1k is actually very feasible(Albeit very briefly imo most won't be able sell there) for GME, that would only be a market cap of less than 100bn. TSLA has a market cap of 671bn for reference. So not totally unbelievable that it could hit that in a fast squeeze.

10k+or whatever weird shit the GME cult likes to spew though is pretty impossible though that would give GME a market cap bigger than Apple which is just ridiculous and bigger than the US GDP at 100k which is just flat out impossible.

gqnj9uj;S7EFEN;1;"So here's my point of view on it-

she's pricing out companies based on their long term value right, but this long term value absolutely does consider cost to borrow. Her assessment of 5 year value can be deadass on point but if rates suddenly blow up her fund is going to lose value as a result because her 5 year valuation is going to shift alongside the price to borrow.

she's not wrong in her assessment but her funds go down in value. that's just part of the inherent risk you choose by picking her fund. it's a part of the design. speculating on the next innovative company is inherently risky

&gt;Without central bank interventions, there is no way her funds would still be around.

well, her funds have been good because her picks have been good, would you not agree? it really hasn't just been TSLA, the ETF as a whole has consistently found gems.

 Say ARKK crashed to 107 like it did last weeks, right, and treasury yields DID go up. Instead of rebounding to 130~ like ARKK did, it'd be sitting at 107 and then slow recover over the next year or so. It would still be a good buy at 107. Because the underlying picks in ARKK are still great, they just got too far ahead of themselves in valuation, valuing their picks based on lower borrow rates.

if you are long on the companies in ARKK or long on Cathie's ability to pick winners a short term correction does not matter. The issue is, the funds have been so good at picking winners (plus ofc, enabled by the market) that you get people who really aren't long on either of these things buying into ARKK just due to its recent success.";investing;2021-03-12 03:43:50

Inflation is good for value stocks that are already profitable and bad for growth stocks. Plus, treasury yields will rise as inflation sets in and if inflation picks up fast, the FED will have to raise interest rates sooner. TSLA investors r betting the company will be profitable in the future. But if the future is set for high inflation, not only will TSLA not be able to grow as fast due to higher production prices, TSLA won‚Äôt be as profitable since no one will be able to afford their cars.

gqne6ks;quaeratioest;1;"I am bearish on TSLA. Be careful with that one. Mkt cap is $700B. Hasn't even come close to growing into that valuation. Fundamentals are deteriorating (Europe, NA sales) and China is looking to retaliate against the US for banning investments in Chinese companies (see Xiaomi et. al.) The Chinese have a big card in their hands when it comes to TSLA, as TSLA's growth relies almost entirely on that market. 

CNBC wants you to buy TSLA at 1500x earnings because they want u to stay poor. The big money with TSLA has been made. Now that it's in the S&amp;P and its volatility is being shorted by big firms via the VIX it's really difficult to gamma squeeze. Sure it can go up some more because they get publicity every hour on CNBC and the CEO feels the need to butt in on every single thing that's going on these days, but I think it should fade.

GME is interesting because it was at a couple hundred million last year. Priced for bankruptcy, except that was never in the cards. HFs, the media, and those dumb idiots on SeekingAlpha were all wrong. At $40 a share, mkt cap was about $2.5B. Which I saw as an insane deal, because it's like 1/3rd of revenue for the only dedicated gaming retailer in the US. Even with a mediocre turn-around, that was a very cheap price. 

Right now, mkt cap is $18B, which is ahead of its fundamentals now (esp. if you look at TTM earnings) but it's all too clear now that management is changing. If Ryan Cohen can make this as successful as CHWY (same revenue as GME now, and also loses money), that's $30B mkt cap according to today's market conditions which although I think it's pretty high, is very possible. We want to look at free cash flow, not EPS, through the next year or so to see how things are going. 

Given how optimistic I am and the insanity of the current market, my base PT for GME is $500/share, which would put it on par with CHWY. I think it could reach that price again soon because of options flows alone. Anyone who is still short this thing will get squeezed. It happened with TSLA, it happened with PLUG, and it will happen to GME too. And it could very well cross my price target due to these short term conditions.

Anyway, that‚Äôs the thing. Could go up or could go down. Gotta take the profits some time. You could have not have taken them when you did and t could have tanked just as easily and you would be upset you didn‚Äôt take them when you did!";wallstreetbets;2021-03-12 02:38:43

Couple rules I follow. If it‚Äôs under $20.00 just buy the shares.

Also I know GE has been on a tear. I jumped in around $6.00 and have rode it up. It‚Äôs actually one of my best performers behind GME lol...

But stocks that have 8 billion shares don‚Äôt tend to move to wildly. It‚Äôs a much slower build vs explosive. Took GE 1 month to go 6-10, 2 months to go from 10-12.

I believe it‚Äôs on the way to 17, but it‚Äôs likely going to take months.

Companies like TSLA, Snow, Docu. 

These stocks religiously move 20% in a week which makes them better option plays IMO.

gqmau74;holengchai;1;"From another post:

 

Not financial advice.

&gt;You need to be careful:  
$45 is 30x revenue (this is higher than TSLA, SNOW, PLTR valuation).  
They were priced at $8bn in Nov, now $30bn mkt caps?  
They sold $520m of series H funding or 12m shares in Jan 2021 so that they did not need to do the IPO's ""offering"" and go direct. What this means is they convinced &lt; 10 investors to pony up the funds for 12m shares at $45 that they can tell you the entire 652 million shares is all worth $45 also.With the IPO route, the bankers would have priced it at $15 and it doubles like AI, ABNB, DASH, so it'd be $30. But they are smart to tell you that it's worth $45, hoping you will pay $70/$80/$90. And if that happens, this stock will be more expensive than any stocks I know.  
Also, why Direct Listing? Because there will not be a lock up period of 180 days. Without it the investors can sell on day 1. But why does it matter? Because after covid, kids will go to school, spend time at pool parties, soccer games than playing. Guess what would happen to earnings and then stock price?  
What they did was brilliant. They did an IPO without and IPO. They got the IPO money with series H funding, then the DPO allowed them to sell on day 1 (using 12/652m shares or 1.8% of shares to pump the value of the company by 300%). They got a sky-high valuation, more than TSLA could. And in their words, they saved $1bn of banker fees. The only losers? I think maybe those who buy from their selling out.

AMC Entertainment (AMC) also grabbed significant attention from users, with shares moving 4% higher the day after it reported better than expected Q4 revenue. Palantir(PLTR) , which along with AMC has been in play on the subreddit for some time, saw its shares jump 7%.

Also grabbing attention was Roblox(RBLX) , which made its market debut on Wednesday through a direct listing on the New York Stock Exchange. Shares Roblox(RBLX) were up 5%.

Perennial fan favorite Tesla (TSLA) also made gains, climbing 4%.

The broader market likewise moved into positive territory. The S&amp;P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average both edged up 1% as the Nasdaq gained 3%.

gqlswnl;majorchamp;1;"I 'may' be completely wrong on what I'm about to say, but I think a lot of people will purchase a long call (like months out) as a hedge against a put sell. And in some cases, people will do spreads simply hoping the price stays between them, and if it gets exercised, I believe the call option is the other leg they can use to offset that cost (in case they are lacking the pure capital to purchase 100 shares of the put option).  My understanding of the potential loophole that has screwed over some people is when the put option ""expires worthless"" (i.e; Friday, 4pm) but after hours trading sends it ITM, and the buyer chooses to exercise it.  In one case with TSLA a few months back this happened, and some guy who expected a $500 loss (premium) max...never had the other leg executed (cause it all happened after hours on a Friday) and his account essentially needed the capital for 100 shares of TSLA and it was like $25,000 or something.";stocks;2021-03-11 19:13:25

We know the world is going to need EVs soon yet all of the stocks went down since January. Sure it'll only go up from here but we don't know when because the rich is still stuck on oil.

Vaccines are needed in the world but their stocks didn't really spike up as much as TSLA or AMAZON did during the pandemic.

I saw EA went down 2010 to $14, heard they were buying stocks to stay alive - they are now $100+ and they're still a shit company.

it's all speculation and popularity and I've watched these things happened behind the scene for too long.

Or maybe they finished selling their calls and loading up on Puts, so they sold the shares they bought that helped drive the price up, which resulted in the price falling. Then they made money on Puts.

If you think they care about playing games on you, you are wrong. They are just trying to make money, same as all of you. You are no more or less principled then them. There are individuals, not just wealthy hedge funds, who made the mistake of selling naked calls here and have lost all their money (look at the lawsuit against dfv... ridiculous as it is, the loser there was no big shot).

Bottom line, most of you are not getting out of GME with profits. Most of you will lose money. As long as you keep the party going you can perhaps avoid that conclusion. This is the same as any stock. I am long in TSLA, and understand that until they one day issue dividends, the only return I can get on the stock is others believing in its value. The problem is there is a huge gap between those holding GME and those not. I figure it is worth between $20 - $60 per share and that sentiment seems to be what most are comfortable with.

gqkparg;Akgopewpew;1;"You are considered the 5% of parents in my book. I am a highschooler that lives in a decent area in the suburbs. A lot of my friends/classmates have no clue how stocks work, nor saving just in general. For example, compounding interest, dividends, calls, puts, etc. I have grown up with my mother and she has been a single mom since I was about 2 years old. When I was in 5th grade she gave me $250 and said ""FInd a company you like and buy their stock."" I had no clue why she told me to do this but I did it anyway. I bought into Microsoft with roughly 6 shares at I believe $55-$65 because I was obsessed with the family computer at that age. Now Microsoft is valued at around $240 a share. This was an important lesson to just buy and hold shares of a company you believe in, rather than do impulsive investing and trying to make a buck. Because of that simple lesson, I have bought into long-term shares of AMD, NVIDIA, TSLA, and lots of swings along the way. I am currently in high school and I can say safely that I am comfortable enough to pay 4 years of college if I chose so. I hope because of this I can implement it into retirement, and be financially comfortable.

gqkouai;BrunoBraunbart;1;"Okay, forget about my first post, learn what options are and how they work and then read it again. This is all really complicated brain-wrinkling stuff, take your time. I recommend the beginner playlist on the youtube channel ""Option Alpha"". 

Regarding your question: An option is a contract that allows the option buyer to buy 100 stocks at the negotiated strike price within a certain time frame, IF HE WANTS. So if the stock stays unter the negotiated price you simply let the option expire. If it's over the price you can execute the option and get the stocks for a discount (and usually sell them right away for profit). This is obviously an unfair situation: the buyer can generate a profit if the stock price is right and doesn't have to buy the stock if the stock price is wrong. So to convince someone to give you such an option you have to pay them a fee. That fee is the option price. Note that there are also put options, that work exactly in the other direction. You can sell 100 stocks at the negotiated price if you want to, so you profit from a decreasing price.

That means, the buyer of the option always bets on a direction and the stock has to significantly move in that direction before he makes a profit. But at that point he can basically have infinite profits in theory. The option seller has way higher odds. He wins if the stock moves in the other direction, he wins if it stays the same, he even wins if it slightly moves in the direction the option buyer wants. But his earnings are capped at the price of the option (the money he got when he sold the option). Search for ""long call option"" and ""short call option"" in google picture search for a good illustration.

It is important to understand that options are traded as well. That means you don't always buy (or sell) an option and wait until the time is over or it is executed, you can also resell your option.

Let's assume you bought a call option for TSLA last monday, when the price of the stock was 570$.You buy an option with the strike price of 670$ and 40 days. The option did cost you 30$. In the morning of tuesday TSLA was trading at 600$. Now your option is obviously way more attractive, since the chance that TSLA rises over 670$ is now better. That means when you would buy the same option now it would cost 38$. That also means you can sell your option again for 38$ making almost 30% profit in less than 24h. 

This is what the ""greeks"" delta, gamma, theta and vega are about. They tell you how the price of the option will change when certain things happen. Delta tells you what happens when the stock price rises 1$. Theta tells you what happens when one day passes (without a movement in price). Vega tells you what happens when the implied volatility (the assumed jumpyness of the stock) changes by one 1%. Gamma is too complicated to explain in text, look up a good video on that, but it's closely linked to delta.";wallstreetbets;2021-03-11 14:17:06

gqkczm9;YungBullGangAutist;1;"Omfg. I keep seeing ‚ÄúBuT wHaT abOUT the FloAt‚Äù. Repeat after me: THE. FLOAT. DOES. NOT. MATTER. 

Nokia has a MARKET CAP of about 22.25 B as I type this. That‚Äôs the important metric here. A company‚Äôs share price is inextricably connected to their market cap. Why? Because (share price x float outstanding = market cap). Yes this can increase dramatically regardless of float because it‚Äôs easier for a ~20B company to go to 100B than it is for a 100B company to go to a 500B company. 

Nokia currently has 5.62billion shares outstanding and trades at roughly 4$ a share. If Nokia were to somehow decrease their shares outstanding to a tenth of that (562 million shares outstanding for you retards) then their share price would be ~40$ a share. If they cut it down one hundredth of that it would be trading at almost 400$ a share with an outstanding float of 56.2 million. But in each of these scenarios the MARKET CAP stays the same. We just saw in this past January the share price increase from 4$ to 6.50$ in a five day period ( a 62.5% increase). The company went from being worth roughly 22B to being worth almost 36B in a five day span. It‚Äôs very easy for the share price to increase because the company isn‚Äôt worth all that much from the start relatively compared to actually overvalued companies like Tesla for example. This is why people saying TSLA can hit 1000$ a share don‚Äôt understand that it would be an increase of 300B to their current market value. Which is actually retarded considering they would be priced for future earnings in the year 2080 or later. 

This is why you can see penny stocks in the bio sector increase by 600-1000% in a very short period. It‚Äôs because their market cap wasn‚Äôt high to begin with. If a hypothetical penny stock has a 500 M market cap and they increase in value to 3B then the shares increase 600%. 

Nokia has a price to sale currently of 0.8327 which is among the lowest compared to their peers. Qualcomm has a price to sale of 5. If for some reason NOK gets overhyped and valued at price to sale of 4.8 which won‚Äôt happen unless they do something insane like build a 5G network on the moon (they are) then they would have a market cap of 133.5B and a share price of roughly 24 $. If you don‚Äôt have any other reason besides ‚ÄúThE FloAt is ToO BiG tO MoVe the STonK‚Äù they you are actually unironically retarded.";wallstreetbets;2021-03-11 12:15:38

not saying the blue chip memes are bad. they're not. dis/fb/aapl are probably your safest bets of all the holding. but whats the point of holding in ARKK when you have PLTR, DKDNG, TSLA and AAPL?

Of-course, any formula or method is to be taken with a pinch of salt. They are only good at providing a ball-park estimate. In my opinion, it's good to filter out undervalued companies and just to add another input before making an investment decision.

gqjbxsc;Pass_Little;3;"Winners rotate.

QQQ has had an incredible run due to the growth in tech post-2008.  

If you look before 2008 you'll find that VTI was winning.

There are signs that this is getting ready to invert, again.  

In the last 6 months, QQQ had cumulative returns of 6.88% which sounds pretty good.   Until you look at VTI and note that its return was 13.78% over that same period.

The year to date is even worse - QQQ only had 0.13% returns, and VTI was up 2.79%.   Note that this is cumulative so you'd expect the 1-month numbers to be lower.

The point of VTI is that you have the right stocks in your portfolio to be earning no matter what the market is doing.   If tech is hot, VTI is growing.   If more traditional stocks are hot, VTI is growing. And so on.     

With QQQ you are basically betting on a very tech-heavy portfolio, which may or may not be the right thing.   No one knows.    With VTI, you may end up underperforming QQQ, but only if tech stocks continue to be overheated as they've been.  With VTI you may end up overperforming QQQ if tech stocks calm down to be more normal levels of growth.

Note that if you had owned QQQ in 2000, you wouldn't have been very happy (dotcom bubble).   With the hyped-up inflation of TSLA and other tech stocks, you might see a similar thing again.  Or not.

A lot of the underlying analysis of this particular discussion can be found over on r/bogleheads where they're more oriented toward indexes and can probably show you numerous backtests to show why a VTI type approach would have been better in certain decades.   The point of all them can be summarized this way:  You never know what's going to happen in the next 25 years, and something like VTI has a proven track record of doing, on average, better than any market-segment approach when you look at the long-term history of the stock market.";stocks;2021-03-11 05:15:25
gqjb7r2;ImNotSmelly;1;"Lets say $TSLA is $200. I believe itll hit $100. I would buy open a put option for hypothetically $2000 from farmer brown who's selling options. I would receive approximately $100 per share if $TSLA hits $100. Options contracts are for 100 shares, $100x100 = $10000 would be my profit on a $2000 put contract.

Now imagine I have crystal ball and I know $TSLA will fall to $100 within the next 2 weeks. I strike a deal with farmer brown and limit the date of my contract to 2 weeks, in exchange, he gives me a 30% discount and I only owe $1700 for this contract.

Because my crystal ball has never let me down. I strike another deal with farmer brown. I tell him Ill only accept the profit below $180, and in exchange, he'll sell me that $1700 contract for 35 cents on the dollar. I just paid $595 for this contract.

The next day $TSLA falls to $180. The contract I paid $595 for is now worth $2000 (as long as its not a friday)

Now lets say I did this whole deal with Farmer brown as $TSLA was  at its peak price. Because of volaltility increased, and swung in my direction, my $2000 contract is now worth $3000 because vega has gone up in my direction.

Lets say $TSLA hits $100 2 days after I purchase the put option and I sell it close. Ill have lost a minute portion over the 2 days due to theta decay, but after accounting for everything my net gain would be around $10k on a $595 investment.

I'm getting price change notifications, but definitely when the price seems to be dropping more often than it is rising, but that is anecdotal, I mean if it ends the day up, I would assume more notice of rise, but it's possible there was actually more notice of drop.

gqiilwi;wsb_shitposting;5;"Bear Case for QQQ tomorrow:

I believe that the drop in the NASDAQ had absolutely nothing to do with bond yield or inflation. I feel like that is proven by the following:

* S&amp;P 500 and Dow-Jones are both at all-time highs
* Bears did not stop pushing the NASDAQ down after 2:00 PM, when it became clear that the bond yield and inflation were not legitimate concerns
* The start of the NASDAQ's dip is timed to GME activity. The first dip came when GME became a major news story and the second dip came when DFV doubled-down on his investment.

I believe that the NASDAQ is actually dropping because of speculation on tech stocks, a prime example being TSLA. Stocks like TSLA have been pushed to unsustainably high levels, and now that the meme stock economy of retail investors have started focusing their attentions elsewhere, this bubble is exploding.

Incidentally, TSLA also started its free-fall drop after the GME short-squeeze.

For these reasons, I do not believe that the NASDAQ is going to go up significantly until, at the soonest, when stimulus checks are received by retail investors.

gqi5esr;BubbaMan10;1;AMD and TSLA are apples and oranges. Although both companies are innovative, AMD created something head and shoulders above their competition, while Intel basically flopped. TSLA will not get that opportunity. The model S will compete with Audi, BMW, Lincoln, Cadillac. The model X must compete with Volvo, VW, Ford etc. And the same with the Y. VW is already going to take over the EV market by 2022, and China sales have slumped as well.

gqi2b42;ShadowLiberal;1;"&gt; I am rather bearish on TSLA, and can see a lot of that money moving into AAPL if they are successful on their car project, **especially when you consider how little of a moat EV companies have in terms of technology (it is relatively simple to create a current-gen EV platform)**

I seriously hope you're joking about this. It takes years of research and development to get where Tesla is today. Apple isn't going to be able to just dump a bunch of money into it and surpass them overnight. Nor are the EV leaders going to stay still while they catch up.

A lot of people made headlines in the last year claiming to have made solid state battery breakthroughs for example. But no one has brought one to market. And now one of the companies that claimed to have made a breakthrough in Solid state batteries is abandoning them all together after finding out they were actually really far away from getting them to work right,  and deciding it just wasn't worth pursuing farther. [Link here](https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/26/22279995/fisker-inc-electric-vehicle-interview-solid-state-batteries-ocean-suv-spac)

While I think there's a lot of good to come in Apple's future, I'm extremely bearish about the Apple car. At best I think it'll be a toy for some ultra rich people who are willing to drop over $100,000 on a car. But as Tesla and other EV companies have shown it's very difficult to be profitable selling only very upper end cars in the EV market. The R&amp;D is just too expensive, and Apple is simply years too late to enter the market and become recognized as the leader of EV's. Tesla is already called the Apple of the auto industry for a reason.

I personally would rather Apple focus on getting their self driving car to work, and then cut deals with other auto makers to let them use it in their cars. That would have much greater potential for profits in my eyes.";investing;2021-03-10 22:21:55

Having majority one stock in your portfolio that you believe in isn't a bad play at all, especially if you strongly believe in said company. When I first started trading a couple years ago, my portfolio was all TSLA and AMD and it did me well. But since then I have been very uncomfortable with how much TSLA has taken over my portfolio, so I sold half and reinvested in other sectors.

But I would argue that having even more than 15% of a portfolio in the most volatile stock on the market is a very risky move. Not good, not bad. You could become a millionaire in a week or go broke tomorrow. Just be aware of what will most likely happen and be prepared.";stocks;2021-03-10 17:52:37

gqgltvc;quinten110;1;" 

Hi everyone,

I have a question about compound interest. When explained, it seems simple enough. But I get stuck at a though and I'd really appreciate someone clearing it up.

So quick fictional example: let's say I buy $10K worth of $TSLA and it grows 20% per year, indefinitely.  
Year 0: 10K

Year 1: 12K

Year 2: 14.4K

Year 3: 17,280

etc. Compound Interest.

Now my question is: If my 10K investment grows 20% in a single day, and again 20% the next day, will I have made 40% on my 10K investment so $14K? Or will I have already started the compound interest on the second day, since I closed at $12K the first day, and now have $14.4K the second day? It's basically a question of the ""cut-off date"" for compound interest to go into effect.

gqglavr;shakespear94;1;"There are multiple reasons for me to not invest long term in TSLA. It‚Äôs become a meme and quite frankly it is one of the only EV companies actively delivering in the US. This simply means one thing, competition is coming. Despite Elon Musk being a bold person, I can‚Äôt shake off the feeling that a ‚Äúmufasa effect will happen‚Äù. Lucid Motors has gone public, NIO is planning US launch... once COVID air clears, there might be even more initiatives from current big dogs to go full or all electric. I also foresee that gasoline/petrol/diesel powered vehicles are very much still alive... think construction, a very large part of an economic system, it cannot thrive without diesel and hydraulic fuels. TSLA does not manufacture these vehicles (or yet), and in order for it to tap that, it would require a helluva lot more mental and paper power. Volvo (an ugly long ticker that I don‚Äôt want to pull up in the AM), is pledging to go all electric by the next 5-10 years. Ford is having great success with Mustang Mach-E (even with a recent recall), and so the current big gasoline dogs have clearly begun making there moves.

This is why my child shall not have shares of TSLA. Yes it ‚Äúcan‚Äù go up, but the numbers don‚Äôt add up. If it goes to $100,000 per share, not a single atom in my body will be sad because we content with our decision now for the future.";stocks;2021-03-10 16:23:16

gqgj963;MasterCookSwag;5;"So I mean the first problem is YouTube is a terrible place to learn about these concepts.  It's usually just some random person offering their unqualified thoughts on something they probably learned via YouTube videos or reddit comments. 

CPI, and inflation, is necessarily an average.  So like saying ""CPI is a bad measure because Education has risen faster than CPI"" is the same as saying ""The S&amp;P 500 is a bad measure of the market, because TSLA has risen much faster"".  Sure, TSLA has risen faster, but there are a ton of stocks that have risen slower - and with inflation nobody sits there and talks about deflation in auto costs, in consumer goods, flat inflation in grocery until recently, etc.  Just focusing on the top end of the average is not a good way to discuss averages. 

Also, many people like to pick apart certain aspects of CPI based on either misunderstandings or just bad faith interpretations.  Here's a great piece if you have the time, I promise you'll understand more about CPI than 99% of this sub if you read this: https://www.bls.gov/opub/mlr/2008/08/art1full.pdf

Also, CPI isn't the only measure of inflation.  There's PCE which is measured and calculated by an entirely different entity and uses an entirely different methodology.  There is also the GDP deflator which works by measuring GDP in last year's prices.  All of these tend to track very closely to each other.  To make an analogy, if someone told you a ruler was inaccurate, but you checked the measurement with three other devices and it came out roughly the same would you still think the ruler inaccurate? 

Here's another good read, a bit higher level as well: https://fredblog.stlouisfed.org/2015/03/the-many-flavors-of-inflation/#:~:text=The%20GDP%20deflator%20considers%20all,private%20consumption%20component%20of%20GDP.";investing;2021-03-10 16:10:31

gqgcsc8;ionized_fallout;8;"March 10 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks jumped on Wednesday with the Dow hitting a record high, as data showed underlying consumer prices remained tepid in February, easing concerns about a spike in inflation.

The 10-year U.S. Treasury yield slipped from its session highs as data showed core consumer prices index, which excludes volatile items such as food and energy, rose less than expected last month.

Focus is on an auction of U.S. 10-year and 30-year debt later in the day for clues to where yields in the recently volatile market may be headed.

""Expectations for near-term inflation to rise is going to remain due to the huge public borrowings, but the tame inflation data that has come today would definitely drive some optimism among investors,"" said Arthur Weise, chief investment officer at Kingsland Growth Advisors in New York.

Accelerated vaccine rollouts and a new hefty round of fiscal stimulus on the horizon have raised bets on higher inflation, triggering a sharp rise in Treasury yields that knocked off the tech-heavy Nasdaq about 7% from its Feb. 12 record closing high.

The United States plans to double its order of the single-shot Johnson &amp; Johnson(JNJ) coronavirus vaccine, procuring an additional 100 million doses, a White House official said on Wednesday.

The Nasdaq extended gains after logging its best one-day percentage jump in four months on Tuesday, helped by a near 20% jump in Tesla Inc's(TSLA) shares as investors picked up momentum stocks that had recently taken a beating due to higher yields.

Amazon.com Inc (AMZN), Microsoft Corp(MSFT) and Tesla extended gains by 0.8% and 4% from the previous session, while economy-linked industrial and financial stocks jumped more than 1% each.

The chunk of a $1.9 trillion relief aid, which is on track to be signed into law later this week, is poised to end up in the stock market and could provide a boost for GameStop(GME) and other stocks popular among retail investors active in online social media forums.

Shares of GameStop(GME) jumped another 19%, setting the videogame retailer on track for its longest streak of daily gains in six months and extending a rally that has already doubled the company's market value.

Among other ""meme"" stocks, Koss Corp(KOSS) and AMC Entertainment(AMC) climbed 52% and 14%.

Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 4.2-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and by a 4.1-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq.

The S&amp;P 500 posted 20 new 52-week highs and no new low, while the Nasdaq recorded 174 new highs and 10 new lows. (Reporting by Medha Singh and Shashank Nayar in Bengaluru; Editing by Maju Samuel)";wallstreetbets;2021-03-10 15:25:17

09:46 AM EST, 03/10/2021 (MT Newswires) -- GameStop(GME) and AMC Entertainment(AMC) , both higher in Wednesday's early regular session, continue to lead mention counts among the WallStreetBets Reddit crowd, but EV stocks led by Tesla (TSLA) and Nio (NIO) are seeing significant herd momentum on the upside.

Tesla and Nio both popped at the open followed by gains in Li Auto(LI) , Xpeng(XPEV) and Plug Power(PLUG) .

Elsewhere, volume interest has been spiking in the cannabis category, with Aphria(APHA) , Tilray(TLRY) and Aurora Cannabis(ACB) recording a jump in average share volume over the last day.

ARK Innovation ETF (ARKK) is up about 1% early Wednesday after soaring more than 10% Tuesday.

Continue watching Palantir(PLTR) as its mention count and share volume interest has been growing.

Valuations might play a part in driving demand for certain stocks, but as we've seen with TSLA and the whole meme stock drama, not to mention the multi-baggers we've seen in high growth stocks with no earnings over the past year, there are lots of other factors that drive demand beyond valuations.;stocks;2021-03-10 14:37:27

* GameStop(GME) set for longest winning streak in six months

* Futures up: Dow 0.55%, S&amp;P 0.40%, Nasdaq 0.59% (Adds comment, details; updates prices)

By Medha Singh and Shashank Nayar

March 10 (Reuters) - Major U.S. stock indexes were set to open higher on Wednesday after data showed underlying consumer prices remained tepid in February, easing concerns about a spike in inflation as an economic recovery gathers momentum.

The 10-year U.S. Treasury yield ticked lower as data showed core consumer prices index inflation rose less than expected as demand for services including airline travel gradually picked up.

Focus is on an auction of U.S. 10-year and 30-year debt later in the day for clues to where yields in the recently volatile market may be headed.

""Expectations for near-term inflation to rise is going to remain due to the huge public borrowings, but the tame inflation data that has come today would definitely drive some optimism among investors,"" said Arthur Weise, chief investment officer at Kingsland Growth Advisors in New York.

At 8:52 a.m. ET, Dow E-minis were up 176 points, or 0.55%, S&amp;P 500 E-minis were up 15.5 points, or 0.4% and Nasdaq 100 E-minis were up 75.5 points, or 0.59%.

Accelerated vaccine rollouts and a new hefty round of fiscal stimulus on the horizon have raised bets on higher inflation, triggering a sharp rise in Treasury yields that knocked off the tech-heavy Nasdaq about 7% from its Feb. 12 record closing high. The Nasdaq logged its best one-day percentage jump in four months on Tuesday, helped by a near 20% jump in Tesla Inc's(TSLA) shares as investors picked up momentum stocks that had recently taken a beating due to higher yields.

Apple Inc (AAPL), Amazon.com Inc(AMZN) and Microsoft Corp(MSFT) extended gains slightly from the previous session, while economy-linked industrial and bank stocks including Boeing Co(BA), Morgan Stanley(MS) and JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co(JPM) also added between 0.8% and 1.2%.

The chunk of a $1.9 trillion relief aid, which is on track to be signed into law later this week, is poised to end up in the stock market and could provide a boost for GameStop(GME) and other stocks popular among retail investors active in online social media forums.

Shares of GameStop(GME) jumped another 12%, setting the videogame retailer on track for its longest streak of daily gains in six months and extending a rally that has already doubled the company's market value.

Among other ""meme"" stocks, Koss Corp(KOSS) and AMC Entertainment(AMC) climbed 44% and 7.4%. (Reporting by Medha Singh and Shashank Nayar in Bengaluru; Editing by Maju Samuel)";wallstreetbets;2021-03-10 14:09:30

gqg1nah;y-c-c;1;"My take is, don't invest in companies that cross your ethical line, but you need to understand what your ethical line is.

Counter to what others are saying here, there are still ways to make good money investing in ethical companies (or those that align with your values). You just need to be more astute. For example, if climate change was a top priority for you, and you invested in TSLA at IPO 11 years ago (~$17), you would easily be a multi-millionaire by now with a 200x return. Not all companies are Tesla, and obviously, don't invest in unprofitable companies just for the sake of it, but it's not like there isn't money to be made.

I did say you need to understand the ethical line, because if you nitpick on every little thing, you will find that you can't invest on anything, and you also have to be naked and starve to death because none of the clothes you can find are ethically produced, and most food on the market aren't grown to high ethical standards. You have to pick your battle.

The last reason I prefer holding stocks in companies that align with my values is that there is no conflicts of interest. If you are holding a stock that goes against your ethical values, your financial incentives are still to want the stock price to go up right? So let's say you own Facebook stocks but strongly believe think they should be regulated and broken up. Would you vote for politicians who want to break up Facebook and potentially tank the stock price, or advocate for it publicly? It just seems to be setting yourself up for these unnecessary ethical dilemma. It's not just about whether you make money or not, but how the investments you hold changes your incentives. (If you are just trading and not holding long-term investments that's a different discussion)";investing;2021-03-10 13:57:00

More seriously though, a fundamental misunderstanding exists on how inflation has been balanced by cost reduction via importing cheaper goods and technology. That will continue to happen, AND the $'s ""exhorbitant priviledge"" will continue to exist.

It‚Äôs really hard to manage your actively manage your portfolio unless it‚Äôs part of your job, it takes research skills, but also time to use those skills (hence why it‚Äôs smarter for people outside of the that industry to have said industry do it for them). So i agree with the idea that it‚Äôs much safer to not speculate and let the people managing ETF‚Äôs do the security analysis. (and it‚Äôs more profitable as it will on average give you better returns at the 15y and 30y mark). 

Also, I‚Äôve performed 4 valuations for different tickers (ORCL, WMT, WM, TSLA) and that shit takes time. It‚Äôs not the hardest thing in the world, but it takes time!

E commerce trades at a significantly higher multiple than brick and mortar. Once they close down a large portion of their physical locations and grow e commerce from 30 percent to 50 or 60 precent of sales they'll absolutely trade at a high multiple and valuation. 

There biggest hurdle is absorbing the impact of a slow transition to digital games. If they solve that by selling more pc hardware or the like then they'll be fine. 

I personally wouldn't buy at these levels until management gives clear direction on what they're doing but op bought at 140 and sold at 40. That was dumb as hell because 140 would have easily been reached within the year. GME was oversold when it was at 40 based on all the new information.

gqftrdn;bigrooster2021;1;"&gt;For newer investors who've been burned in the last few weeks: The difference between being an early stage investor in Facebook, Google, TSLA and what most people are putting their $ into now is that the aforementioned companies had enormous moats and little competition in a huge growth field.  
&gt;  
&gt;Essentially, they had a stupid easy path to growth and profitability, and a lot of super easy ways to defend their market position in the 10 years going forward. **They also had great valuations, even as they ipo'ed**.

So a drawdown of 20%+ after a 150%+ year (a la Cathie Wood) due to short term rotation is ""getting burned"" LOL? Try thinking long term.

There were plenty of people saying Facebook, Google, and especially Tesla were overvalued back then. Not saying people should invest in SPAC's with no revenue but there's a middle ground between buying value traps which you would be doing if you followed people's advice in this thread and buying companies that are just an idea trading for multi-billion dollar valuations.

gqfqxvc;slbaaron;1;"EA is a public company, you can look at the ER. They have plenty of MTX. 

TSLA has been a one in a million event, and largely comes from people's belief in Elon as a leader plus multiple rounds of gamma / short squeeze - people going crazy on GME but TSLA literally did it first on the back of actual company turn arounds / growth at the same time. If Ryan Cohen can do a good job then GME will get there too but irrelevant here. 

Trust me when I say if Elon completely stepped away from TSLA then likely more than half the valuation will evaporate. It's not a reasonable justification, but that's how TSLA is valued right now. Who's the Elon for Roblox to justify the current valuation even with the stretch of the imagination? 

I'm here for a discussion, but I hope for your sake that you will both stand behind your statements and have a successful position out of it as I won't be touching it and will have no stake in it. 

I've bought ETSY in 2019 when people is saying they have no place to grow other than filling in their niche. Bought SHOP in 2018 when people said it can't compete with Amazon. Bought SQ in 2017. Even bought GME at $16 well before it became national news.

&gt;You need to be careful:   
&gt;  
&gt;1) $45 is 30x revenue (this is higher than TSLA, SNOW, PLTR valuation).  
&gt;  
&gt; 2) They were priced at $8bn in Nov, now $30bn mkt caps?   
&gt;  
&gt;3) They sold $520m of series H funding or 12m shares in Jan 2021 so that they did not need to do the IPO's ""offering"" and go direct. What this means is they convinced &lt; 10 investors to pony up the funds for 12m shares at $45 that they can tell you the entire 652 million shares is all worth $45 also.  
&gt;  
&gt;With the IPO route, the bankers would have priced it at $15 and it doubles like AI, ABNB, DASH, so it'd be $30. But they are smart to tell you that it's worth $45, hoping you will pay $70/$80/$90. And if that happens, this stock will be more expensive than any stocks I know.  
&gt;  
&gt;Also, why Direct Listing? Because there will not be a lock up period of 180 days. Without it the investors can sell on day 1. But why does it matter? Because after covid, kids will go to school, spend time at pool parties, soccer games than playing. Guess what would happen to earnings and then stock price?  
&gt;  
&gt;What they did was brilliant. They did an IPO without and IPO. They got the IPO money with series H funding, then the DPO allowed them to sell on day 1 (using 12/652m shares or 1.8% of shares to pump the value of the company by 300%). They got a sky-high valuation, more than TSLA could. And in their words, they saved $1bn of banker fees. The only losers? I think maybe those who buy from their selling out.

I don‚Äôt know maybe GME literally never sells off and it‚Äôs the new TSLA being valued at a multiple of 2030 sales.

If you just want to increase your risk profile but don't know what's going on then I think if you start allocating capital towards ARK funds which basically take the work load needed. Look into which ARK fund you like and allocate 25% of your account towards it or something.

If you want to be more hands on and be even riskier, you're going to have to just read a lot and look into tickers that come up and start picking your own stocks. Interestingly, most of these hype stocks like TSLA, PLTR, etc. are all already in the ARK funds so in the end, if you like a particular stock like TSLA over everything else then you could just allocate more money to TSLA than everything else vs. it being capped at 10% in an ARKK fund.

If you're not confident in your own skills, broad indexes are great. After this recent reset, I feel confident saying that ARK Invest ETFs are a solid play (I actually bought in). Don't let the banks reap the rewards of your capital, use it to your own benefit. 

That's the long game. Regarding the short game, here we go... Honestly, I'm no financial advisor or anything... I do this because the news was an interest of mine since I was in high school back in the early 2000's.... some people like weed, I like the information stream, and analysis of the data.

  
I can't tell you what to do, as I don't have the qualifications to do so, but I can tell you what I will do tomorrow. But I don't know what I will do until the time comes (I shed half my TSLA calls today because it was outside my risk tolerance). Trading is not investing, things are subject to change at a moments notice. This is not the long game.

If you're online all day tomorrow, check back here ever so often because I will list my personal play for you to monitor. However, I should note that I will only put up aprx. 20% of my portfolio value because that's all my risk tolerance will allow me to do. DO NOT DO WHAT I DO because there is ZERO guarantee it works. If you look at my prior posts, you will see that I share the notes of my research... I'm not going in blind. I make my plays because I'm confident. Maybe you're not confident about the same. People have also pointed out flaws in my theories in the past, this is why I post and crowdsource for feedback.

Best of luck to you my friend.";StockMarket;2021-03-10 03:26:48

If you know the yahoo finance site, you can go look at the stock price for TSLA. On dec 31 2020 it closed at 705. Entire January it ran up. The first dip came around Jan 26th. So in our calendars that was still 2021. If you follow a different calendar then it may be a different year.

gqdprlw;Eminence120;2;"The issue with it being like 2008 is that  a security that was essentially valueless low rated mortgages at risk of failure were propped up by a massive betting scheme that created one of the largest bubbles we have ever seen. Almost everyone in the financial industry was long these mortgage backed securities and as we know not many people shorted them. I don't feel that short squeezes in either gme or amc or whatever meme stock as affecting the market for too long. Sure, some of these hedges will have to sell some of their value based securities to cover their short position. This may cause a general market sell off and a major correction. But the recovery from this correction would be quick as there are PLENTY of buyers with dry powder waiting to jump on those value stocks. Look at what happened with TSLA and other growth plays today. It is clear that many were waiting for a moment to pounce. If TSLA was essentially valueless then yes that would cause a general market crash as so many institutions are long TSLA. But they aren't so it won't happen that way.

gqdn96p;ZeroTolerrance;2;TSLA absolutely ripped today. Up 20% and it's not some small company. It gained nearly 140 billion in market cap in 1 day.;wallstreetbets;2021-03-09 21:57:59
gqdn5fv;8zMLYq;1;The Taycan is is a complete car, with zero cut corners anywhere, from the fit and finish, to the feel while driving, to the placement of every single button. Whereas the Model S appears to be in beta test mode with an interior thats laughable.  Side note, Porsche also reached 2nd place in reliability this year with JD. Unless taking roadtrips are part of your day to day life, the increase in range comes with tremendous downsides. If Tsla actually adds a functional interior, lower seating position, improved brake feel, improve suspension, improved track performance, lower center of gravity, improved sensory feel and an actual rewarding driving experience.... how much will it cost?;stocks;2021-03-09 21:57:11

I made a lot of money on TSLA when it was doing the same thing. A lot of people felt like they ‚Äúmissed the boat‚Äù but they were too focused on their feelings and not what the stock was telling them. 

Of course nothing is guaranteed, but I swear I have yet to lose money buying FDs after days like today (don‚Äôt recommend for GME, buy shares obv.)

gqdhejp;wmzombie;-6;I think TSLA is undervalued. I think we might see a very quick bounce back of the stock especially bc it‚Äôs had a massive sell off for the past 2ish months;wallstreetbets;2021-03-09 21:14:30
gqdh8vd;futureIsYes;1;"It depends. So far, taking profit mostly have caused me pain. Examples are ENPH (I got out at 96), PINS (I got out at around 40),  TSLA (most painful one, exited at 350, pre-split, after buying it around 250).

But on the other hand, there are cases where I wish I had taken profit, and see all of it disappear or get reduced tremendously.

For example, MGNI. I was up almost 130%, now in two weeks, that has been reduced to just 70%. IQQH, I was up almost 50% at some point, now -9%. 

So probably the best decision is to set some limit. e.g. I take x% out, if it grows to y%. You set the x and y based on how confident you are on the company. For example, for a solid company like APPLE, MSFT, etc, x will be very low, and y will be high, while for a biotech company that is not generating any revenue yet but riding on good expectations/story, you can have x quite high (e.g. take 50% out when the gain is 100%, basically letting just the profit ride...)

gqdcbyx;Brave_Sir_Rennie;4;"Good practice? I don't know, but it matches my risk tolerance.

&amp;#x200B;

You can use 20/20 hindsight for your case study:

if you'd bought AMZN early -- 1998 for $4 (or whatever it was in '98) -- and sold after it doubled, or increased 40%, or  increased 10%, ... you'd have doubled your money! Or made 40%!! Or made 10%!!! Great! Ah, but look at that lost opportunity!

A buy and hold would have been the obvious hindsight-adjusted thing to do.

But you didn't know that at the time.

So would there have been an approach to hedge your risk against both future/unknown stock price trajectories? An obvious approach is to take :some: of your winnings off the table, turn them from paper gains into real gains, ... but let the rest ride. If they double again, or go up 40% again, take a little more off the table.  If you want to dip into market timing -- and the adage is that time in market beats market timing -- then sell a little at highs, play the volatility and buy back in at lows (it's tough to spot the lows, obv., but you know it was lower than it was).

Two of my recent ""mistakes"" with this ""lock in some gains"" approach is that I missed the recent massive run ups in both TSLA and PYPL.  I've been long on PYPL and recently/lastyear bought TSLA.  Both moved up 20% from my purchase price -- in my book 20% is a fairly decent return over a ""short"" period -- so I sold enough to recoup my purchase price. And then when my remaining shares went up another 20%, I sold them for what I embraced as a huge win.   ... and then I watched as both doubled repeatedly after I'd exited all of my positions. :sigh:  But, look, I made a bunch and should be thrilled.  But, ... how to finesse next time to hedge against that lost opportunity?";stocks;2021-03-09 20:37:37

* GameStop(GME) builds on Monday's 40% surge

* Indexes up: Dow 0.74%, S&amp;P 2.01%, Nasdaq 4.10% (Updates prices, adds analyst comment)

By Herbert Lash and Karen Pierog

March 9 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks advanced on Tuesday, with the Nasdaq jumping about 4% to recoup its losses from the previous session, as U.S. bond yields retreated and investors scooped up battered technology stocks.

Tesla Inc (TSLA) jumped about 19%, while Apple Inc(AAPL) , Amazon.com Inc(AMZN) and Microsoft Corp(MSFT) gained between 3.3% and 4.4% after sharp losses in recent weeks as a rise in yields raised concerns over their high valuations.

News that a $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief package was nearing final approval sparked a spike in yields on Monday, pushing the tech-heavy Nasdaq to end more than 10% below its Feb. 12 closing high, confirming a correction for the index.

U.S. 10-year Treasury note yields eased to as low as 1.523% after hovering near 13-month highs of 1.613% in the prior session. Longer-dated yields have jumped over the last month as investors price in a faster-than-expected economic rebound and higher inflation.

The market is adjusting to the new level in interest rates, said Kristina Hooper, chief global market strategist at Invesco in New York. Companies whose products and services are in demand when the economy is doing well, known as cyclicals, and small-cap stocks will outperform this year, she said. Tech will end the year higher but not be the leader as it was in the past year's rally.

""Today the 10-year is down a bit, and that takes pressure off valuations, so tech is performing well,"" Hooper said. ""The market is just about getting comfortable at this level of rates.""

Rising interest rates disproportionately hurt high-growth tech companies because they are valued on earnings expected years into the future rather than profits earned in the short term.

""Potential headwind for the market is (when) interest rates rise further from this point over the short period ... since they have risen too fast in too little time,"" said Michael Sheldon, chief investment officer at RDM Financial in Westport, Connecticut.

By 2:50 p.m. ET (1950 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 234.05 points, or 0.74%, to 32,036.49, the S&amp;P 500 gained 76.96 points, or 2.01%, to 3,898.31 and the Nasdaq Composite added 517.57 points, or 4.1%, to 13,126.73.

The rise in Treasury yields has accelerated a rotation from ""stay-at-home"" winners to stocks primed to benefit from an economic reopening, setting the blue-chip Dow on pace to end at a record high on Tuesday.

While the Russell 2000 growth index jumped over 3.2% on Tuesday, compared to a 0.7% rise in Russell 2000 value index , it has sharply underperformed its value counterpart since the start of the month.

Shares of Tesla surged 19% on Tuesday, rebounding from a deep sell-off and putting the automaker on track for its largest one-day gain in nearly eight years.

The global economic outlook has brightened as vaccine rollouts gain speed and the United States launches a massive new stimulus package, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development said, hiking its 2021 growth forecasts.

The Democrat-controlled U.S. House of Representatives will take up the relief bill on Wednesday, with the chamber's expected approval leading to President Joe Biden's signing the legislation into law later this week.

The bank index dropped 0.39% after vaulting to a new 14-year peak. Economy-linked financials, materials and industrials hovered near record highs.

GameStop (GME) was up 22%, building on Monday's rise of over 40% on the video retailer's e-commerce strategy and speculation that small investors will pour stimulus checks into markets.

Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 2.31-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 3.58-to-1 ratio favored advancers.

The S&amp;P 500 posted 37 new 52-week highs and no new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 214 new highs and 15 new lows.

Even if it was just ""TSLA/Rivian does the semi, but has no plans for the bus."" - that might help to make the DD more well rounded, as there are a number of similarities between the brands and if TSLA did decide to get into this space... it could be very scary for other smaller manufacturers trying to get going.

Seems the real test will be in the coming days when it seems reasonable to expect a bit of a retreat from today's exuberance. When TSLA (or insert any other highly valued and somewhat speculative tech) dips 2% intraday, will people run for the exits again? If not, things may get cooking again and SPY can break over this stubborn resistance line. We shall see, I have no idea where it'll go. Personally, I'm not loading back up on tech.

gqc5lyj;agoodusernameno1has;1;"First, Small Cap will outperform in early cycle, which we are in.  

Second, Value is beating growth because of yield increases.

Third, the small cap fund you buy is very important bc they follow different indicies   IJR follows S&amp;P 600 and is a pure small cap core fund.  VBR follows the CRSP Small Cap Value - CRSP has a lot of overlap in capitalization spaces bc of how they calculate their index - a lot of mid cap in their small cap funds, a lot of large cap in their mid cap funds, a lot of mid cap in their large cap funds.  SLYV is a pure S&amp;P 600 value fund.  IWN will track the Russell 2000 Small Cap value, which is better than CRSP with overlap but is less tax efficient.

As you would imgaine they all have varying returns as a result.

YTD:
IJR - 19.79% (S&amp;P 600 Core)
VBR - 15.93% (more mid cap based on CRSP)
SLYV - 26.37% (Pure S&amp;P 600 value)
IWN  - 21.72% (Russell 2000 Value)

Finally, I have said it before and have been downvoted and I dont care and will say it again.  ARK funds are speculative dogshit funds and Cathy is replicating the .com star stock picker model.  It has a PE ratio of 52.97 bc of TSLA, but the majority of its holdings have negative PE (read PE of 0).  She will kill in periods of irrational exuberence but the funds will lag when fundamentals become important, which is most of the time.  TSLA alone has dropped 1/3 of its value, another sword I constantly fall on when I tell people it is overvalued and get downvoted to hell.
 
You may not remember the dot com bubble but I do.  Its a spitting image.

Anyway, what funds you pick matter.";investing;2021-03-09 15:34:34

* GameStop(GME) builds on Monday's 40% surge

* Indexes up: Dow 0.53%, S&amp;P 1.49%, Nasdaq 3.17% (Adds comment, details; updates prices)

By Shashank Nayar and Medha Singh

March 9 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks advanced on Tuesday, with the Nasdaq jumping over 3% to recoup its losses in the previous session as U.S. bond yields retreated and investors picked up battered technology stocks.

Among the biggest boosts to the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq were Tesla Inc(TSLA), Apple Inc(AAPL), Amazon.com Inc(AMZN), Facebook Inc(FB) and Microsoft Corp(MSFT) jumped between 2.4% and 7.2% after sharp losses in recent weeks as a rise in yields raised concerns over their high valuations.

Signs that a $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief package was closing in on final approval sparked a spike in yields on Monday, pushing the tech-heavy Nasdaq to end more than 10% below its Feb. 12 closing high that confirmed a correction.

U.S. 10-year Treasury bond yields eased to 1.54% after hovering near 13-month highs of 1.613% in the prior session. Longer-dated yields have jumped over the last month as investors price in a faster-than-expected economic rebound and higher inflation.

Higher yields can weigh even more on tech and growth stocks with lofty valuations, as they threaten to erode the value of their longer-term cash flows.

""Tech stocks are overdue for some kind of bounce after the downfall they have had so far with most investor maintaining a positive outlook (on them) in the medium to longer term,"" said Michael Sheldon, chief investment officer at RDM Financial in Westport, Connecticut.

""Potential headwind for the market is if interest rates rise further from this point over the short period... since they have risen too fast in too little time.""

At 9:59 a.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 168.01 points, or 0.53%, to 31,970.45, the S&amp;P 500 gained 57.06 points, or 1.49%, to 3,878.41 and the Nasdaq Composite gained 399.55 points, or 3.17%, to 13,008.71.

The rise in yields has accelerated a rotation from ""stay-at-home"" winners to stocks primed to benefit from an economic reopening, helping the blue-chip Dow hit an intraday record high on Monday.

The global economic outlook has brightened as vaccine rollouts gain speed and the United States launches a massive new stimulus package, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development said, hiking its 2021 growth forecasts.

The U.S. House of Representatives could approve the relief bill as early as Tuesday, with a vote allowing the Democratic president to sign the legislation into law later this week.

The bank index dropped 2% after vaulting to a new 14-year peak. Financials and energy sectors were in the red.

GameStop (GME) was up 18%, building on Monday's rise of over 40% on the video retailer's e-commerce strategy and speculation that small investors will pour stimulus checks into markets.

Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 2-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and by a 3.2-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq.

The S&amp;P 500 posted 15 new 52-week highs and no new low, while the Nasdaq recorded 131 new highs and eight new lows. (Reporting by Shashank Nayar and Medha Singh in Bengaluru; Editing by Maju Samuel)";wallstreetbets;2021-03-09 15:16:51

If I was you, i would look at stocks that have a very steady value. ie, their beta is close to 1. That way, you're not just gambling. Cause right now, I'd say that you should put your money in ETFs and only invest in stocks with dividends because if you aren't researching the shit out of any companies, then you're pretty much gambling.   


For the most part, Cannabis companies may grow, but look at any company and their finances are garbage. I can't find one company that has good finances that is in the weed business.

gqbbt22;Positive_Judgment581;1;"I just started trading (not investing, no patience for that) a few weeks ago, and this is what I think I've learned.

* Timing the dip is profitable. It pays to suffer a couple of 1% stop losses, if you catch the 10% bounce.
* Stock moves on real news, and Twitter is the fastest news source out there.
* If I'm any good at this, I should be able to turn ‚Ç¨500 into ‚Ç¨1000 within weeks. If not, no harm done.

Not that it matters, because as soon as the market opens, I behave very differently. So far, my main mistakes are:

* Urge to gamble. ""Nothing is happening. Let's just bet 50 on $GME, maybe I get lucky.""
* Unwillingness to accept defeat. ""I'm sure the stock will pick up again soon"", followed by ""I wish I had accepted my incorrect bet at -4%""
* Faux pattern recognition. ""$TSLA must go back up now, right? \*bets all with 5x leverage WRONG"" and ""$TSLA is falling of a cliff, nothing will stop it now. \*bets all with 5x leverage WRONG"".

gqb50gy;ElectricalGremlin;1;"As a person who has done testing with them through Navistar, they still do not have much skin in the game. Sure, they teamed up with Daimler to electrify their products, and sure, they have their own bus line but there are a few factors here that most people dont know about the trucking industry and might pose a long term issue to Proterra:

1. People in the trucking industry are generally slower to change from whatever diesel, ng, and gasoline vehicles they have to electric, just because of emissions leniency in that marketplace compared to regular consumer vehicles. Because of that, the head start is not something that weighs heavy imo and the market will have plenty of opportunities to catch up. California is a big one, but the bigger projects, such as a few school bus projects,, were awarded to competitors over Proterra.  iirc. IC Bus comes to mind.
2. Bus's are also not exactly the biggest market to brag about if we are talking specifically about their ZX5/ZDi/S1LF electric bus's in comparison to the whole trucking market. Other competitors will have similar vehicles out  in the next year or so and while Proterra is already out and with sales, these OEMS will come out with vehicles that have similar eMPG's and will probably aim to be cheaper based on expected sales volume and will have the supplier support and brand recognition that Proterra does not have yet. Once these products come out, it might be an issue for Proterra (speculating here, prove me wrong tbh, would like to learn)

A perfect Example of what I mean in terms of Brand recognition and missed opportunities: IC Bus currently takes up  50% + of the market in school busses and have contracts with California already awarded for their eCharge Bus. This bus hasnt really even been released yet, but with majority of the market share, we still got the contract. I can imagine stuff like this will occur as time goes on and with market saturation in EV Bus's.

3. Who is to say that Daimler will not pull out of their partnership with Proterra? There are other battery powertrain competitors out there now that will be willing to provide drivetrains, cheaper than Proterra would in the future. Not to mention, this is Daimler we are talking about. They, just like VW have more than enough capabilities to take up their own EV architecture in the next few years (They already are) and scale up for the trucking industry. 

4. For other types of trucks, vocational, heavy duty, long haul.... Hydrogen Power might be the better alternative long  term. The battery drivetrain is great until a load is given. The eMPG's do tend to drop significantly for applications where there might be a payload of atleast 15000 lbs or higher. The industry already recognizes that and is straying away from batteries for that  reason, except for Bus's if anything.

TLDR: Proterra imo, would be awesome if they had a head start and became the TSLA of trucks, but they dont and the trucking industry isnt the same as the consumer vehicle market, By the time they are out with any product outside of the Bus's that they have, they will be behind the industry leaders imo. These numbers wont mean anything knowing that Tesla, International/GM, VW, Volvo, and (yes, even) Daimler are already working on EV/ Hydrogen trucks.";investing;2021-03-09 08:47:16

gqb0yml;dizzy_centrifuge;1;For a put you're paying a premium let's say 1.00 for a TSLA 200 P with expiring 3/19 which means that you expect the price of TSLA to drop below 200 by that date so 200 is your strike price. The 1.00 premium is what you pay per share in an options contract which contains 100 shares so you pay 100 for the put initially. Your breakeven is 200-1=199/share and if it falls below that you're profiting. Now lets say it's 3/18 and TSLA skyrocketed and the price went up instead of down so with only a day left your put is now 0.01 ie you can sell it for $1 this is the most you'll lose as the put expires worthless on 3/19. If you short at 400 and it goes up to 405 you have to buy back the shares at a loss of $5 each if the price doubles you'd be on the hook for 800/share. Because there's technically no upper bound on the price of a stock there's no limit to how much you'll have to pay to rebuy those shares;wallstreetbets;2021-03-09 07:42:39

Banking institutions aren't even financing new coal mining operations, and Saudi Arabia just announced that they're investing heavily in green alternatives to ween off crude oil. 

Oil just isn't a stable resource anymore, it causes more headaches than it will resolve long term, and to curb the effects of global warming it's going to need to become a staple.

gq9uxe4;rhetorical_twix;1;"&gt; However, I think there has to be something I can learn from this besides ""I trusted my gut"". I'm wondering if those things I classified as red flags may be able to help other investors on this sub in the future. Did anyone else see what I saw? What are your thoughts?

The move with Bitcoin was what I saw as ""jumping the shark"". Jumping the shark is when a sitcom has exhaused all of its story lines and starts having its characters do stupid things just for drama. 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jumping_the_shark 

&gt; The idiom ""jumping the shark"" is pejorative, most commonly used in reference to unsuccessful gimmicks for promoting something. It is similar to ""past its peak"", but it more specifically suggests an unwillingness to acknowledge the fact. Originally, the phrase was used to describe an episode of a television comedy with a gimmick or unlikely occurrence desperately attempting to keep viewers' interest. Moments labeled as ""jumping the shark"" are considered indications that writers have exhausted their focus, that the show has strayed irretrievably from an older and better formula, or that the series as a whole is declining in quality.

When Elon Musk did that bitcoin thing, TSLA started to drop (after the initial cryptocurrency enthusiasm bump), because apparently a lot of investors saw it as TSLA being out of moves and resorting to jumping the shark.";stocks;2021-03-09 00:18:21

gq9ciqm;jamez_eh;4;"Doordash is an IPO play. Basically what happened is that once shares were available to buy, retail swooped in and shot the price up over 100% of the original offering price of $102 to something in the mid $220's. This means it was probably pretty overvalued and perfect for a correction.

One of the main reasons for this is that only a small fraction of the total shares were available to purchase. This means that retail kept bidding the shares higher and higher, presuming incorrectly that they were trading a company worth over 70 billion when the real float value was a lot smaller than that. 

So now that we know that the company is overvalued doesn't mean anything unless we have some sentiment swings or catalysts. I never buy puts unless these exist TSLA was impossible to buy puts against for a year because there were not catalysts to pull the share value down. The most obvious example of this is an earnings call, but for IPOs the big one is called the lockup, when this happens a lot more shares flood the market because now the employees can sell the shares they were given as part of their compensation package. Doordash's early lockup was always known to be mid March.

This alone makes it a pretty good play, but back in February we could also see that bond yields were rising and there was a movement into reopening plays (Doordash benefits from the pandemic).

It was basically the perfect storm to crush this stock.";wallstreetbets;2021-03-08 21:44:26

gq92sor;ionized_fallout;7;"March 8 (Reuters) - The Dow climbed on Monday, led by stocks poised to benefit the most from an economic rebound as the $1.9 trillion COVID-19 relief bill awaited a final Congressional vote this week, and heavyweight tech-related stocks swung between gains and losses.

After the legislation won U.S. Senate approval on Saturday, President Joe Biden said he hoped for a quick passage of the revised coronavirus relief package by the Democrat-controlled House of Representatives so he could sign it and send $1,400 direct payments to Americans.

Prospects of more government spending and faster economic growth have stoked fears of a spike in inflation, sending the benchmark 10-year Treasury yield to near one-year highs.

U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, however, said on Monday the package would fuel a ""very strong"" U.S. recovery and she did not expect the economy to run too hot because of the increased spending.

The Dow hit a new record intraday high and was trading above its Feb. 24 record close. In the S&amp;P 500, the financial sector was the biggest boost, hitting a record as higher interest rates and a steeper yield curve helped banks. Industrials were right behind, also reaching a record high, while the materials sector neared an all-time peak. The technology sector was deepest in the red.

""This is an ideal traders' market with certain sectors and individual stocks performing better than the wider market, as investors pick and choose individual stocks that will perform better as the economy reopens,"" said Anthony Denier, chief executive officer of trading platform Webull.

A slide in the big tech stocks that have driven the rally in equities since pandemic-induced lows of last March continued, with Apple Inc(AAPL), Nvidia Corp(NVDA), Tesla Inc(TSLA) and Alphabet Inc's(GOOG) Google leading declining shares on Nasdaq.

Tech stocks are particularly sensitive to rising yields because their value rests heavily on earnings in the future, which are discounted more deeply when bond returns go up.

The divergence between the tech stocks and non-tech stocks explains trading today, said Joe Saluzzi, partner and co-founder of Themis Trading in Chatham, New Jersey.

""The stimulus package will be certainly helping the bigger cap names,"" Saluzzi said, referring to non-tech stocks. ""The get-out and non-stay at home stocks are doing better now,"" he said.

By 3:09 p.m. ET (2009 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 416.64 points, or 1.32%, to 31,912.94, the S&amp;P 500 lost 3.83 points, or 0.10%, to 3,838.11 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 259.71 points, or 2.01%, to 12,660.44.

Banks added about 1.7% as the yield on the benchmark 10-year note stood near a 13-month high, while airlines jumped about 5%.

Walt Disney Co (DIS) jumped about 5.8% as California health officials set new rules that would allow Disneyland and other theme parks, stadiums and outdoor entertainment venues to reopen as early as April 1.

GameStop Corp (GME) surged about 33% after the company said it had tapped shareholder Ryan Cohen to lead a transition to an e-commerce business.

Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.68-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.28-to-1 ratio favored advancers.

The S&amp;P 500 posted 124 new 52-week highs and no new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 390 new highs and 21 new lows.

Of course the first one can't be ignored, especially to find big discrepancies (TSLA would be a good example), but if the company is solid and they have an advantage (whether it be proprietary, widespread adoption or almost cult like loyalty), then being currently overvalued a little isn't a big issue for years down the road. Yes you could get lucky and get a more decent valuation in a dip (like Apple is doing), but it could also continue to run. For the long run and with solid companies, the most important is getting in at a price that you feel is close enough to fair value. Value analytics are more important for short term gains.;stocks;2021-03-08 18:32:10
gq8lvkv;Avloren;1;"You're speaking with the benefit of hindsight. In hindsight, sure, it seems obvious that TSLA's ridiculous explosion of value was sustainable and justified by potential future value, and not a bubble about to burst. At the time, many thought otherwise. In hindsight, GME's $400 price tag was an unjustified bubble certain to collapse. At the time, many thought otherwise. Without hindsight, nothing is certain.

It's easy right now for us to look back and say that the TSLA and GME situations were very different. If you had been 100% sure of that in advance, and able to wager some money on your predictions, you wouldn't be posting here now. You'd be sipping a Mai Tai on your private island. At least, that's where I'd be, not sure about you.

So when you use that word - ""they'll *certainly* be able to straighten out their finances.."" - I'm telling you, you can't say that. No predictions about the market's future behavior are certain. You can do all the research you want, you can be 99% sure, but remember that the guys shorting GME when it was $15 were 99% sure and they were wrong. Sometimes, a margin call is the only way for a broker to ensure 100% certainty.

Also: your analogy breaks down at ""infinite apartments"" - nothing is infinite, not even a broker's cash/shares available to loan out. It may be a very, very large finite amount, and very few situations test exactly how finite it is, but a short squeeze potentially can.";stocks;2021-03-08 18:31:38

However if everything is falling then I may not have the ammo to buy all of it.  For me what I have invested is significantly greater than my reserves /new money to buy dips.  A lot of conversations about the lost decade are to show the volatility and that everything doesn't always go up.  

For me personally my worst investment was back in 2000.  I had gotten in early on JDSU which you could consider today's TSLA it was the hot thing that had great prospects and made a lot of people including me a lot of money.  It crashed hard in 2000 and possibly into 2001.  I bought a lot of dips and ended up losing money even though I would have still been up if I had just held firm or sold at the dips considering how early I had gotten in.

Look, I was gonna buy Yeezys with GOOG
and make some extra tendies...
But I‚Äôm only going to get this one chance
Something‚Äôs right, I can feel it. 
Six minutes, stop trading, you Aut....
Just a feeling I‚Äôve got, like something‚Äôs about to happen, but I don‚Äôt know what. 
If this means what I think it means, then we‚Äôre in a bubble, big bubble. 
The market‚Äôs as bananas as you say, and I‚Äôm still taking chances.
You were just what the Don ordered.

Now who thinks their ARM‚Äôs long enough to chance stocks
They say I see stock hops;

backpack: stacks, crack, yep, yackidy-yac
And at the exact same time a bee see‚Äôs these miracle Alphabet stunts while I'm buzzing 
That I'll still be able to make a put when things are stable 
Go forth and back with a couple of options that leave me with half.
Only realized it was ironic I had alpha bet Alphabet after the fact. 
How come I‚Äôm not pro? All I do is watch F bomb, see my math was just wack. 
Gay bears are having a rough time period, here's a Maxipad 
I‚Äôm actually disastrously bad:

Well, to be truthful the blueprint's simply rates and useless exuberance
Everybody loves to root for a nuisance
Hit that Coke, KO, ass destroyed, did nothing but shoot for the moon since

I'm a sober man, pinch your salt and a lime and drink Jos√©, burro. 
It's me, my honesty's brutal
But it's honestly futile if I don't utilize what I do though
For good at least once in a while
So I wanna make sure somewhere in this rippin‚Äô stash I sniffle and snoodle
Enough times to maybe to try and help get some people through tough times
But I gotta keep a few cokelines just in case 'cause even you un-fined 
SNAPpers are hungry looking at me like it's lunchtime
I know there was a time where one guy
Was king of Wall Street Bets, 
but I still cap like I'm on my Palantir Calls grind
So at lunch time, I eat the plants you combine
Appear with the teeth color of dimes
I got too big and here they come trying to
CRSPR you like that one line 
I snort, say ‚ÄúI'm Back‚Äù from the bathroom: U-P 
Hun, when I tried to say I'll take seven nugs from Calls; I‚Äôm buyin‚Äô 
Put 'em all in a line, add an A1, 57, a Ray‚Äôs bottle and the Heintz
See if I get away with it now that I ain't as long as I was, but I'm
Morphin' into an immortal coming through Zuck‚Äôs portal
You're stuck in a damn short from 2004 though
And I don't know what the hyuk that you goof for
You're pointless as Jeff Bezos with fucking cornrows
You play normal, Zuck‚Äôs being normal
And I just bought a new rail gun from the future
Just to train and shoot ya like when 
Elon Musk made LA mad
'Cause Dad said they looked like a drag at rush hour(s): sad. 
Blingin' like a Chad while they placate E, ya know
Man, oh man, that was a 24/7 special on the cable channel
So JPow went straight to the radio station the very next day
""Hey, Bears, I'mma kill you""
Currency coming at you at supersonic speed, (JPow Dad)
‚ÄúUh, sit down Elon here‚Äôs a comma, 
 you assuming I'm a human
What I gotta do to get it through to you I'm superhuman
Innovative and I'm made to borrow
So that anything I  say is repo trading off The Street and it'll go to you
Investigating? 
More than ever demonstrating
How to give a WallStreetBettin' aut-ience a feeling like it‚Äôs levitating
Never trading, and I know that the gaybears are forever waiting
For the day that they can say I fell off, they'd be celebrating
'Cause I know the way to get 'em motivated
I make quantitative easing, 
Leaves you qualitative wheezing
Oh, he's on livestream
Well, that's what they do when the coronavirus, makes them use it
It's not drip drop, or pop, 'cause trickle down bubbles won‚Äôt refuse it
We rock: bought yachts and docks
Type in ‚ÄúLosers Sell‚Äù and make 'em lose it
I don't know how to make gains like that
I don't know what terms to use
Let me know when it occurs to you
While I'm zipping any one of these purses:  Diverse? Hurts you
It's curtains, I'm inadvertently hurtin' you
How many purses I gotta purchase to
Prove that if you were half as iced, 
your shlong might cease being a virgin, dude. GUH!
School flunkie, pill junky
But look at the ALPO-plays the skills brung me
Full of dog food, but still hungry
I bully myself 'cause I make me do what I put my coins to
And I'm a million leagues below you, 
ill when I speak in tongues
But it's still tongue in cheek: GUH *whew*
I‚Äôm sunk so Tesla take the fucking wheel, I'm asleep in the front seat
Pumping Double-D‚Äôs with the Boys, still chunky butt funky
But in my head there's something I can feel tugging and struggling
Elon fights with da Bears and, 
here's what they want from E:
They asking E to eliminate some of the ICE-y hate
But if you take into consideration the bitter hatred He has 
Then you may be a little patient and more sympathetic to the situation
And understand the diss to the nation
Buttfuck it, Ford's handing us lemons, buy ELONmade then
But if E can't better the OEMen how the fuck is he supposed to buy them a stake then?
Don't mistake him for Satan
It's a fatal mistake if you think he needs to be overseein‚Äô 
Or take a vacation to help a Ford  
And make Ford fall on it‚Äôs face; 
You can diss-regard  
Be a king? Think hard, why make the bling when you can be a ‚Äòtard?";wallstreetbets;2021-03-08 16:46:20

I bought AMZN, AMD, NVDA and TSLA in 08 and was called a moron for ""not learning my mistakes from dot com bubble"".

TSLA was viewed at the same level NKLA is currently viewed as, a blue print stage only scam.

AMZN was called a failing business as news and media kept spreading ""FUD"" that nobody would want to shop online when they could go down to get things after inspecting it. Because ""people like to get a feel before buying things"", shortsighted but people agreed with it. Which was why you deserve the money from investing in it early.

AMD had diminishing market share y-o-y because of INTC growing dominance

Square was called a PayPal rip off

Online piracy was big, people just yoink files off torrent sites. People thought it was stupid to ever ""pay"" to watch movies so both Roku and NFLX was thought to fail eventually because ""they had no backing from big media players neither"".

Tech and everything green/future only became the most lucrative stock sectors to invest in in recent years, the market was backwards and barely budged post dot com boom.

gq65ez4;cwdawg15;1;"Just keep in mind this portfolio will be heavily biased in Tech and heavily biased in growth companies that will be more volatile. You will do better some years, but be more exposed during downturns. You will be downplaying many industrial, financials, healthcare etc...

Look at the top 20-30 holdings in VOO, QQQ, and some of the ARK funds and you will see a great deal of overlap, so if you want to add diversity you need to be conscious of what you're overlapping and what isn't.

Some brokerage firms have a view that will show you how exposed you are to a single stock, including the percentage of holdings in an ETF. You will be heavily exposed to APPL, TSLA, AMZN, MSFT, and GOOG.

Most of you're exposure to Mid-caps will be a few volatile companies held in ARK funds.

I also would forgo VOO and choose a mix between VOOG and VOOV (or SPYG and SPYV). You can balance more funds in VOOV when you think some of the growth funds are going through a period when they are bubbling and you can balance towards growth when you feel there are years of growth ahead.

Check into Mid-cap ETF, both Value and Growth. The Russell 2000 or S&amp;P 400 indexes would be a good palce to start. There are times Mid-caps so better or worse than the large-caps. This should be a smaller portion of you portfolio &lt;10%, but it should balanced within that 10%.

One last thing, value funds do better over time than many realize. The key thing is you have to turn dividend reinvestment on in your brokerage account. You also have to look at calculations of 'cumulative investment return' vs. 'unrealized gains' to see it.

What happens in dividend reinvestments is it will dilute your unrealized gains percentage as your recent dividends reinvestments have little changed from their purchase prices. Also your gains through dividends won't be included in your unrealized gains. So one such value fund I'm in has unrealized gains of 30%, but my cumulative investment return is 90%. My comparable growth fund bought near the same time is unrealized gain of 95% and cumulative gain of 110%";stocks;2021-03-08 02:55:10

gq620wc;taintmoun;1;"I believe both 10 year interest rate and NASDAQ will find co-existing way. 

There will be only 3 outcomes: 

1) Interest rate goes up: when it goes up and up (like stonk only goes up), Fed will take an action such as smooth operation or buying more bonds. This will cause reasons for Fed to step in rather than shrugging off shoulder

2) Interest rate stalls: This is probably most ideal. While economy is kicking up, tech stock will be able to buy some times, meaning that when economy is back to normal, their earning will also reflect growth and will justify the current price. With bond rate stalling, when Q1 2021 are announced, earning will start to give more reasons to go up for tech stocks. 

3) Interest rate falls: Well, Fed will have another reasons to step in using smooth operation as well to artificially hike the rate, but this is almost little to none in current economy landscape when trillions of dollars are spent.

I think Wall Street is just driving the rate higher so that they can appeal to Fed and get what they want: Fed buying in more bond, but even if that's accomplished, tech stock will go up. 

Ultimately, anyone with reasonable sense of common sense will agree that TSLA and green energy are the future in 21st century than XOM/CVY, meaning that those tech stock will determine the future of this country. I would not rule out that 20th century industry such as XOM/JPM will be the leading stock for next couple of months, if not weeks, but it's really up to American publics to decide the future.
