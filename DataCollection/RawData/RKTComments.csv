gr82nyb;robertleeblairjr;1;Agreed. RKT had a potential for a Gamma Squeeze on options and short positions, which began a couple of weeks ago. Hence, the surge in price from 19-20 up to 42-43 in 3-4 days. This potential is starting to fizzle and I believe the 3/19 and 3/26 upcoming are catalysts which if not triggered, then it‚Äôs probability has decreased tremendously. At least, it‚Äôs found a new floor from the price action to trade higher than where it was strangled. I believe UWMC will increase as well. But, it‚Äôs not high risk and not ‚Äúrocketing‚Äù up either to double in the next couple of weeks. There‚Äôs not enough OI for the float which is larger as well. It‚Äôs catalyst for the most growth will be buying in April from being added to Russell. However, I would cap that at about 12-13 after it settles. I‚Äôll probably pick up some for a short swing. But, si don‚Äôt expect to get more than 20-30% off of it. It‚Äôs not a YOLO play.;wallstreetbets;2021-03-17 10:47:08

gr74ul7;mailseth;1;"For what it's worth, people with quite a lot of experience in the market were watching RKT closely and still didn't cash out. Don't be too hard on yourself for not selling at the top. Instead be happy that you correctly found a stock that had the upside that it did. That's better than many people can claim.

As far as advice goes: buy stocks that you don't expect to sell for at least a year. After holding for over a year you only get hit with long-term capital gains tax, which is much cheaper than short term taxes. If you sell a stock after every bump, you might miss out on much larger gains in the future (and you get hit with higher taxes on your gains.)

For example, I sold my TSLA (after holding for years) at the top of the market a year ago at a 3x gain (\~$170 per share). Not bad, but if I had ridden out the dip for another 12 months I would have made at least an additional 4x on top of that.";stocks;2021-03-17 02:54:01

gr7350y;Original-Baki;1;"**RKT doesn't retain the mortgages.** Of course housing demand has an impact on the business *but not a direct impact*. They can still GROW the business if the demand for housing is down. This is because their growth will come from gobbling up more brokers for their platform.

For example:

* Let's say housing demand declines by 2%
* RKT can still grow because their growth comes from the number of brokers using their platform. They still have &gt;50% of the market still available for them to grow into.
* So in a year where housing demand is down by 2% - they can still grow the business by 4-8%

Now they aren't completely insulated from the housing market but their business model provides good protection from the swings in the market. They say in a gold rush, sell the pick-axes, and that's exactly what RKT does.";wallstreetbets;2021-03-17 02:37:49

gr72d4l;Dans2016;2;"&gt;RKT insulates it's business from interest rates because they are a workflow platform like ASANA that also provides leads for their mortgage broker customers like an Uber for Mortgages  
&gt;  
&gt;More importantly, RKT business model revolves around pushing their software to brokers, so they are not as directly impacted by decreased home purchasing as a mortgage broker. It's all about gobbling market share as a workflow platform.

Completely agree with this (above) part.

However, I still think the following would affect the housing/real estate market:

People are rich now than before is not completely true: Then why we need all these stimi? We (people) have to pay these off in the future in the form of tax.  That's an expense to regular folks - no matter what they say about ""taxing the rich"".  Rich became richer after rona anyway.

If people have more money now, they should not be leaving the cities but that's not what's happening.  They have saved enough for a reset, i.e., move to a cheaper place because they're uncertain about the future (income).  I some look for farms to make homesteads.  That means they're worried about their jobs, too.

Rising taxes and interest rates, along with a possible burst of this Fed created bubble in the market would turn the current very bullish sentiment to exact opposite pretty quickly.

The other part we did not talk about mortgage backed securities (MBS) and what would happen if people are unable to pay their mortgages.  Fed would not allow a crash in housing market because of MBS they have purchased, I guess.";wallstreetbets;2021-03-17 02:30:39

gr6aec6;I_am_just_saying;-4;"UWMC already had a really inorganic PnD attempt on here just 2 weeks ago. It coincided exactly with RKT blow out earnings, announcement of a RKT special divi, and stock buyback program that caused RKT to run.

UWMC on AH March 2nd (same day as RKT run) and Pre Market March 3rd ran like crazy and immediately normalized at market open in what looked a lot like manipulation. This place along with subreddits options, stocks, and investing was crawling with UWMC bots shilling the fuck out of it.

In the short term, there is no catalyst to cause UWMC to run; its been trading down for months, rates are increasing, everyone is predicting a cooling market, and they just announced they are going to war with RKT. Its bad all around.

Could it pop again? Sure anything can in this market. But, If you step into this you are stepping into an inorganic casino that just hired a bunch of actors to try and lure you in a couple weeks ago that is now filled with two mob bosses trying to rig the game in their favor shooting at eachother across the casino floor.

It seems simple enough but I have to ask, how much micro-managing do you have to perform?  you buyand sell based on the afortmentioned indicators, do you watch for them or have some form of notification via trading view (which i will have to aquate myself with)

I trade/invest on Freetrade (free account) which is buy &amp; sell only, no SL or TP but the urge to constantly check the market is there so the fear I am missing out is always there since it's always in my face.

as mentioned I'm only investing ¬£90 which is desposible income, I would blow it on some random crap if i didn't invest it but my goal is to out perform the banks interest on my main saving pot.   I could add funds but I want to keep it at a level where I can reasonably make more than ¬£30 pa and don't mind too much if i loose it all.

Once I use my savings (house) then i may consider some more long term investments 5 year +.

I used Freetrade as it's free and i can purchase partial shares, working with small capital would limit me to pennystocks but i bought;

$CRSR

$AMC (meme i know but sitting at +35%)

¬£IUKP

$BA

$PLYA

$RKT

$HUYA

¬£AV

and for a while the majority were green but thats only 2 months.

certainly using additional tools such as tradingview rather than the colour of my investment gain/loss would most likely be a better indicator of what i should be doing.";stocks;2021-03-16 17:31:42

gr54769;BrotherLuminous;2;So whenever someone goes short and is successful, that success is added to the value of their portfolio.. many take that value and go do other plays with it if they see that this one is working out.  A week ago GOEV and other SPACs were trash and the market hated tech and evs as well.  Currently there has been a sudden revaluation of this stock causing the shorts to have this margin eaten away... I feel that the bulk of shorts are short from 17 or 18 so essentially we are knocking on the door of breaking even and have spent considerably short interest (read sold more shares short) at this level bringing that average price down...  At a certain level their account goes negative and they get a margin call which is fine the money now or we liquidate your portfolio to get that money which means they sell their assets to purchase shares of GOEV... Smaller accounts may have already blown yesterday but I'd you look at the price action of RKT during it's squeeze you basically saw nothing but some junior trader taking someone's portfolio they spent a decade amassing and  robobuying RKT at the ask... I expect this to happen here at price levels of 24 or 25...;wallstreetbets;2021-03-16 17:05:53

gr4qvlg;mynameisnemix;13;RKT is at 26.34 break out is past 27 at that time a huge ass amount of calls will go ITM. Don't miss the second gamma squeeze on this stock.;wallstreetbets;2021-03-16 15:27:34
gr4qnyd;OG-Pine;1;"I agree with everything you said, especially with regard to holding the stock after exercising. 

But if you have options that are ITM then you can exercise and sell the stock immediately. For example, you paid $200 for $40 call options with a break even of $42 that expire today. The stock is at $41. You can let the option expire and do nothing, in which case you lose the $200 premium and nothing more. Or, you can exercise the call and get 100 shares of RKT for $40, then sell immediately for $41. Now you lost $200 in premium but made back $100 in stock value, for a net loss of $100. 

In most cases it makes sense to sell the option because it will always be worth at least as much as the intrinsic value it holds. But if there are no buyers then you can exercise and sell the stock immediately (don‚Äôt hold for a week hoping for a squeeze). That way there‚Äôs no additional risk but you gain the $1/share.";wallstreetbets;2021-03-16 15:26:00
gr4ptfn;AM_Lite;1;"some brokers will automatically exercise and others do not.

As far as it expiring ITM, sometimes people don't want to bag hold in case the stock drops unexpectedly, so options are sometimes safer. We also have to consider that there was a premium cost that they paid to buy the option. So if you bought RKT call options at a strike price of $40 for a Premium of $2, you would have paid $200 to own that call option. To exercise and break even the stock will need to be @ $42 with the exception that you do not try to sell that option to someone else before it expires (it also becomes nearly worthless the day of the expiration date if there is not enough volume). If the day comes that the stock is expiring and the stock does go to $40, you could choose to exercise it and own the stock (with the hope that it isn't done squeezing and people are not giving up on the stock) BUT if it starts dropping afterward, you are now taking even more lost. Obviously, if your gamble goes well and there is enough support for RKT to go past $42 the following week (\*EHEM\* because people are actually buying the stock rather than just buying call options), then great call. So the question is really do you want to take that gamble. Not a lot of options traders will. Would you rather lose that $200 for the premium or lose more for a bad gamble by exercising the stock at $40 and then the following week it is back at $26 (you now hold the 100 stock but currently at a value of -$1600 hoping for the day that people quit buying just options and will save you)?

Then you might say, well what if they do exercise the call and then choose to hold the stock. If they were going to hold it, why didn't they just buy it in the first place...easy answer: quick flips.";wallstreetbets;2021-03-16 15:19:36

Open up trading view and play with the charts a bit.

Click on f(x) indicator and then enable some of the built in ones.

Best DD is the ones you do yourself and see with your own eyes. Use the DD to help guide you.

If you want to see the OBV (On-balance Volume) that some of DD here has been talking about you can compare GME OBV to another ticker like TSLA of AAPL.

You will see some something interesting.

So they borrowed over 30.000.000 shorts of AMC as well of BB they borrowed over 90.000.000 RKT shorts and this only yesterday. Borrowed shorts can be used for three days. HF wants all of you to feel secure to invest your money, your stimmy on an obviously winning horse and then they will drag the price down so badly that all of you will lose a third or even all of your money. This is why they don‚Äôt fight a rising stock. It‚Äôs like attracting bees with honey. Don‚Äôt fall for their tricks and tactics try to be pragmatic.

I also think it's very likely to be deemed illegal and lawsuits will follow. If it's deemed legal though, huge upside. If they lose in courts, only lawyer fees are lost so in that way it's low risk high reward.

gr3idmj;aka0007;1;"lol.

I literally said in my comment he gets his share via his noncontrolling interest and someone posts about the Class D shares in response. It is pretty clear 99% of the people here have no idea what the term noncontrolling interest even means. It is disheartening as you literally have people investing, trading, and taking all sorts of risk and they have no idea the basics of the capital structure here, which is kind of critical in trying to understand an entity like RKT.

For anyone who is struggling with what noncontrolling interest is. When you consolidate a subsidiary, if there is outside ownership of the subsidiary it is shown as noncontrolling interest in the liability section of a financial statement. On the income statement the share of income attributed to the noncontrolling interest is deducted prior to net income. The net income, which is after the noncontrolling interest, is what the shareholders of the reporting entity participate in.

In terms of RKT, the Class A and Class D are shares in RKT, the top-level (reporting) entity, whereas the noncontrolling interest is roughly the 95%, non-voting (hence in this case noncontrolling, despite the about 95% economic ownership) ownership of the subsidiary entity that is consolidated into RKT. Via the Class D shares, Gilbert has voting rights in RKT and de facto control over the entity. Via his noncontrolling interest in the subsidiary, he receives his economic interest and presumably his share of any dividend/distribution.

Gilbert has rights to convert his noncontrolling interest into shares of RKT that have economic participation. When converting, the portion of the subsidiary that RKT owns would go up accordingly (and the portion the noncontrolling interest would go down). In essence this conversion provision simply enables Gilbert to one day sell his ownership of in the business. It should not change in any meaningful way his economic interest in the business itself.";wallstreetbets;2021-03-16 06:25:11

gr3e0s2;aka0007;1;"Your comment is a good example of a little knowledge is dangerous.

The Class D shares are his voting interest in RKT and you are correct they have no economic interest.

What you are missing is RKT is a holding company for about 5% of the underlying business. Dan Gilbert via his own entities owns about 95% of that underlying entity. This is reported as ""noncontrolling interest"" on the financial.

That ""noncontrolling interest"" in the underlying entity has no voting rights, but has full economic rights.

So, via his Class D shares in RKT, he has control over RKT and accordingly the underlying business, and via his noncontrolling interest in the underlying entity he gets his economic benefit.

So noncontrolling interest = yes dividend (or distribution if the underlying entity is not a corp).

I see it as harmful to the absolutely unique situation surrounding GME... because it effectively dilutes available retail capital away from the only of-the-two stocks that can actually squeeze to an astronomical level.

gr0vaha;kale_boriak;1;"okay broski, then let's break it down.

You state

&gt;Starting in May '68, let's say we started investing with 60 shares for a 6,000 USD position with 4K left in cash. Two months later we hit a low of 88 USD per share, meaning we now own 80 shares at roughly 7,000 USD with a little over 2K in cash. We dip to below 72 in May '70 resulting in 100 shares with 800 USD remaining in cash.

This is inaccurate.  you would buy initial 60@100 for 6000, then buy 20 (wrong) additional at 90 for 1800 more, and then 20 (wrong) more at 80 for 1600 more and you'd have $600 cash not $800.  Why ""(wrong)""? buying 20% at the first stop down would not be 20 shares each time, it would be 12 shares the first time, and 14.4 (round to 14) the second time (20% of existing position), so you're in for an additional $1080 + $1120 for those lots and would be at 86 shares for $8200 (95.35/share avg) and $1800 cash left.

then you state:

&gt;We hit four profit targets on the way up to 105 USD and end up with 80 shares and 2.6K in cash for a total of 11K USD. That's already doubling our profits while significantly reducing our exposure at any given time!

assuming a bottom of 70.01 to make the math easier to follow, and not trigger a third buy that you don't have cash for the full purchase anyhow - you would hit profit targets at 77, 84, 91, 98, 105 and sell 4.3 shares (4 if no partials) at 77 bringing count to 82 shares, then 4 more at 84 bringing count to 78, 4 at 91 count to 74, 4 at 98 count to 70, then 3 or 4 depending how you round at 105 - let's say 4 and count to 66.

You end up collecting $1820 cash from those sales, and have 66 shares @ 105 + 3620 cash total. That adds up to $6930 in SPY and $3620 in cash for a total of $10550.  Yes, you made money.  But had you just bought 100@100, you'd have 100@105 for $10500.  So you didn't double your profits with you trading strategy, you made $50 with trading strategy.  You doubled your profits by taking liberties with the numbers, as I stated originally.

There is something to value averaging, but don't fool yourself with sloppy math.

As for you doing ""the same thing"" with RKT, congrats, you trimmed your position when your ticker mooned - again, that's a good idea, but it's not some esoteric market secret - and you didn't even follow the same formula that you're fighting so hard for that you laid out in your original post.  you just sold chunks for profit rather arbitrarily.  If you got in at 20, then by your own rules you should have started selling out at 22.  You didn't follow the rules you set up, and then it worked out.  That's not evidence that the broken rules work.

Again, you're not wrong, averaging down, trimming up, they're good ideas, but don't let inaccuracy make you fool yourself.";investing;2021-03-15 15:54:18

Just bought a new call @25.39 for 4/01.

I'm predicting a strong week on RKT based on my noob understanding of chart analysis. Not financial advice, please do your own confirmation bias.

I got in late to the DKNG play as I was bag holding and still am RKT lol. So had to wait for more funds to transfer.

Well I still nearly doubled my money on 3/19 $72 calls. Except I got greedy and didn‚Äôt sell üòÇ and will sell today no idea if it will be loss or gain but that‚Äôs a lesson learned. 

Anyways I do have some questions for you. I have sometime trouble following what you‚Äôre saying. What is RAMBO?? And FOMC?

What‚Äôs a non-ER pump mean? 

It seems like since got said your confidence is low this week, AAPL seems like the closest to a ‚Äúsure‚Äù bet. 

I only got $1k currently to play with (hope I can rid of my RKt bags soon, specially if i can get the $1k to cover the loss).

  at 1:00:10  bought 6x  RKT 05MAR21 31.0 C     $0.30 each

   (RKT was worth about $29)

  at 1:16:53    *sold* **1**   RKT 05MAR21 31.0C    $5.07   ($477 profit)

(RKT was worth about $32.75)

gqzhabc;Dorktastical;1;"You lose less on calls if you start OOM, also you make more even if it doesn't meet the strike.   As long as you don't wait until expiration.   Look for calls that will have their delta go way up with a 1$ increase.

for example,
 4/01 24.89$ on my screen shows 2.96 ($296) delta 0.555 gamma 0.067
 4/01 27.89$ shows 2.00 ($200) delta 0.384 gamma 0.058

last underlying price = 25.01

based on these prices (which are the closing prices from Friday, not what it'll open up to tomorrow)
if rkt goes up $1 then:
   24.89$ strike will be worth 351.50 (18.75% increase) delta will become 0.623
   27.89$ strike will be worth 238.50 (19.25% increase) delta will become 0.444

if it goes up 2$:
   24.89$ strike will be worth $413.80 (39.8% increase)
   27.78$ strike will be worth $282.90 (41.5% increase)

if you go deeper otm then the returns just get better and better..
 35.89$ strike +1$ to underlying : 19.77% +2$ : 43.1%

but where things really get better is when there is a big jump, the option's implied volatility increases, which greatly increases gamma and the base premium that the delta is applied to.   If it suddenly jumps a few $ then, I don't know how to calculate what they will be worth, but as long as you choose an option that is highly desired (large volume, large open interest, and the best way IMO to determine, is a narrow bid/ask spread) then the values will immediately jump 100%-300% for each of these, because they have suddenly been deemed plausible.   This is how people got away with buying deep OTM 800$ strike calls for cheap before GME's separate run - basically, the raw numbers made the option traders think it isn't going to happen, though real world activity suggested it could. As soon as GME went past $100 suddenly those 800$ calls looked pretty good and printed even if they were sold right away.

The catch is you absolutely cannot hold these deep OTM options through to expiry, and should flip them very soon after the price action stops - the IV will decay daily, in addition to the theta decaying the price as time goes on

real life example:
  march 9 11:24:39am:
        bought 4 RKT march 12 26.39$ calls for 0.33 each (33$)
  march 9 1:17:15pm:
        sold 2 (of the same) for 1.25 each ($125 each)
   match 9 2:59:11pm:
        sold 2 for $1.29 each ($129 each)

it is not really the best example of going deep OTM .. the week before I had much crazier success but it is a PITA to bring up trades older than 7 days in interactive brokers";wallstreetbets;2021-03-15 05:36:32

The put positions need to cover their costs (if they are naked shorts) on lets say GME and RKT. Might as well make it as cheap as possible for them, scare the crowd. GME has been flatbacked as a 19 yr old white chick, and has been bouncing off a single support / resistance line. 

something I NEVER noticed, RKT has been glass ceiling'ed since IPO. WEIRD!

SO, If apes are holding, ""good institutions"" are holding,  but shorts are bleeding, they need to cover..but how? they either pay the current price or ""kick the can"" to a future date. either way, this is going to BLEED money on the hedge side. 

If one were to try and ""insulate"" themselves from loss, why not play the game hedges are playing on the entire market, not GME. 

Catch 22 either way for the market entirely, as i see it, this shit was leveraged last year which banks were fine with......until recently I.E. TDA suspending short selling on GME/RKT as of friday.

I exited before 200 on this latest bounce, but no real regrets. Take profits, don't time peaks: beating the market by years is plenty, solid DD don't mean shit sometimes, etc etc. RKT cemented those lessons while still making me money. Getting paid to learn is A+++.

But I think round 2 is whales using retail. I hope retail wins. I hope hedgefunds burn in the process. But, in reality, I'd let 1% money raw dog for a nice dinner and making my portfolio grinchey all year round.

Unfortunately I think this GME shit is here for the next ~5 years. Even if it dumps to $30, ANY news is going to spur GME MOON. Cohen played pocket pool at a press meeting? That's a metaphor for the earth and moon reaching each other!?!?!?! Ahhhhhh!!!!

gqyv721;Jim-Kool-Aid-Jones;1;"Great write up!  Definitely a solid basis for a pile of optimism.  Honestly I don't know how AMC could be positioned better.  My concern with AMC is their propensity to increase stock.  I get that they had to do something due to the pandemic, but I don't think they can really do that again any time soon.  Neither do I believe they will. 

GME is just insane no matter how one looks at it.  I am a full retard so this isn't advice but it appears to my novice eyes that GME has three way phenomena happening: Short Squeeze, Gamma Squeeze and the X variable of a massive retail following who is literally buying everything GME, no matter the price.  I don't see that changing especially considering the influx of stimmy payments hitting retail investors banks even now. 

I don't know about RKT.  I have some but I just don't have enough verified info to make an educated guess.  I believe OP is right though. 

BB is one of my favorites.  I have a mountain of BB stock and have had it for months.  I think the EV variable for them is going to shoot it into the stratosphere.  Maybe I am wrong but it sure smells and looks good.  

I am trying to edumicate myself about the ramifications of the 3/5/21 DTCC proposed rule.  Where are the wiggly angles for HFs etc to wriggle their way out of it.  There has to be a couple. At first glance it looks like a great change for our stonks but again, my novice brain just figured out what the hell a ""Put"" is last week....so F-Me if I have any confidence of my interpretation(s) of the ramifications for this rule.  TO THE INTERNETZ!!

gqy1xxi;Boomtown626;1;"In the weeks leading up to earnings on Nov 10, RKT traded between $19 and $21. On Nov 10, they announced $1.21 EPS compared to $0.79 estimates. RKT was right at $20 at the time. RKT spent the entire next 3 months trading sideways, between $18 and $21, while the rest of the market went through a massive speculative euphoria. 

On Feb 25, RKT announced $1.14 EPS compared to $0.855 estimates. It spiked above $40 and now appears to be settling around $25. 

The spike to 40 seemed odd, but the 3 months prior of trading sideways is the part that REALLY made no sense. Its P/S ratio was below 8, while its ROE was stupid high, over 28%. 

The fact that I can't quite pin down the correlation, if any, between RKT's share price and reality is the only reason I'm not back in. (Cashed out at $41.) 

When I bought shares in mid-November, I would have been floored to find out that 4 months later it's only at $25, but the 25% increase since then is a very reasonable move for a company whose numbers look like theirs do.";stocks;2021-03-14 21:20:45

Well, it would be one thing to buy now, before they fix everything, even partially. But share prices have not caught up with neither the pandemic close down nor the limited profit after they'll be allowed to sail at all, which is in the future. Once the prices crash, then it could be reasonable to buy and hold. Amc and gme are one thing, a huge gamble, but ccl i wouldn't even gamble on. But then I went and looked at the 12 month price.

gqwhlp1;BrotherLuminous;1;"Thanks,

There is some deeper discussion of the bull üêÇ thesis and strategy in edition #5. This chart is currently a battleground, there is nothing about it that is natural other than the grass over the bearteaps.   A summary of the thesis is 

1 9 million of SI accumulated from a price point of 17ish on down. utilization is 100 so they are out of cheap ammo. 
2. Sudden market turn around caught them off guard limiting their ability to orderly file out without losing money
3. At the time the mpg hadn't happens but catalyst in play will revalue the company (seems like it has on multiple levels)
4. A study of the options ladder reveals intelligent violent intent on  deep pocketed longs who will punish the shorts and cause a squeeze. Sympathetic longs and orc horde retail have joined.
5. Violent intent confirmed on subsequent trading days of gap openings weaponizing the gamma ramp throughout last week


Because the march aspect of the gamma ramp is so energetic I would look to a continuation of the gap openings for Monday and crossing the important @16 dollar line as that's when the Delta of 17.5 wakes up and drags shorts underwater.  I suspect 25 is when they get margin called as the 30s will wake up.  If this happens then I expected to see a RKT like squeeze

gqvvd00;lulmagician;1;"Yes, I too think that $RKT is undervalued.
I'm thinking of getting in on it for the long run, but there's some things to take into consideration IMO:

- Mortgage rates are starting to recover(rise) from the lower values in 2020. This will maybe somewhat lower the people buying properties, which will (in theory), lower $RKT profit numbers.

- Debt to asset is at ~83% as of today. Usually having higher d2a lowers a company's ability to freely invest in innovation and growing their business. (This is far from the worst d2a, just something to keep in mind.)

- The stock is still being shorted HEAVILY in my opinion.
Last trading session was around 38% being shorted of the available stock float.


On the positive side, the sentiment is high for $RKT.
They also authorized a $1bn stock buyback following the results achieved in 2020, meaning that the company has matured financially.

Anywho, I still think that $RKT is a solid play, even at $25.
The CEO is VERY bullish, as he thinks that even at $43, the stock is still heavily undervalued compared to competitors. The company drives real value for it's customers and it has a pretty solid market cap.
I'm probably going in with $10k this week into $RKT.

gqvpchb;holengchai;1;"I think the statement of trying to make obsolete an entire profession is abit extreme. The key point here is disrupting, i don't think RKT can replace legacy brokers completely, but it innovate on the problem and provide a different solution in hope for a more efficient/effective system. The current system is inefficient and I will leave it at that. Something that is not efficient today, doesn't mean it can't be made better over time..

I see RKT as a disruption to the industry, just like how Paypal have disrupted digital payment back in the days - people were saying they have credit card, they don't need Paypal, and see where it's at now. GooglePay, ApplePay and many follow suit.

Redfin is already disrupting the realtor market. Did they make realtor obsolete? I don't think so, home buyer/seller can still choose to go with old school realtor and pay their 3%+3% commission if they hate money that much. Because of Redfin, home buyers and sellers are paying less whether they use Redfin or independent realtor nowadays. It gives consumer a choice and an opportunity for a different ecosystem to innovate.

When Amazon launch their online store, people were laughing that online store will not succeed because people can't see what they are buying. And yet, we have so many of these online store nowadays. Did it wipe out B&amp;M? Don't think so, but it disrupted it.

But honestly, right now, reason why I'm still holding to see it through (and yes, this may seem self-fulfilling/circular) is GME just got a foothold with momentum ahead of those. Look at some other popular memestock like AMC (same ""squeeze"" potential and ""solid"" fundamentals), it's been floundering because it just didn't receive as much retail impetus and media attention. 

And I haven't read on SKT/RKT since I have no positions with them but at least for you to be aware, GME next week alone (at least with respect to the squeeze) has stuff like:

1) Stimulus speculators riding the hype or ""movement"";

2) Current calls for a shareholder recall to force shorts/MMs to sort out the shares;

3) Bonds issued by GME that are maturing on the 15th and being settled well unlike what shorts hoped;

4) Congress hearing on the 17th; and 

5) Stuff like the new DTCC disclosure rules, the conference call on the 23rd with ecommerce ""whizkid"" Ryan Cohen, quadruple witching hour on the 19th and ETF shenanigans holding GME.

I know it might all be a nothing sandwhich but I am definitely holding to see the fruition of this shitshow (which might be next week as stated or some longer timeframe). If it pops off given these catalysts, I'll cashout and maybe leave a few shares to ride the long term potential. If it doesn't pop off, I've already made six digits and still have that long term potential.
 
In short, I do not see SKT/RKT having these same contextual factors and catalysts available. There's still time to speculate.";stocks;2021-03-14 01:13:40

1) If it's an old company it turns a profit or at least has for a sustained period.
2) It could have been getting shorted from that time, but if I'm not mistaken it was comfortably above $10 for a decent while and then the price started to drop, nothing else massvely changed to warrant that imo. 
3) It certainly shouldn't drop the price.
4) It could have been shorted since then, and because it's profitable it didn't go under...tbf it's a mystery to me because nothing major happened that year to warrant the drop. Tin hat for me there I guess.
5) It gets enough shine to do well recently which is nice and I earned a little profit already which I'm too stupid to cash in on.
6) Cinema + Girlfriend was the crux of my point there. Historically good things happen there.
7) We're now 1-1 for tin hat theories! But seriously, the entry rate is low and affordable for those who don't have the initial funds to drop into GME and Two meme stonks isn't too much imo.
First I seen of GME it was a sign that made the front page of Reddit saying GME/AMC GO BRRR. And it caught my attention..Do if it was a diversion it worked to opposite for me because I now have shares in both.
8) We're good.
9) I personally consider cinemas to be a relavtively safe bet but personall preference there.
10) I agree, You could be right about PLTR, I like RKT myself too because they are a genuinely successful company also.
So shares in AMC, PLTR, RKT, and GME is not a bad ""bet"" imo and I don't think any is a distraction from the other because everyone knows them at this point.

Hope that halps.";wallstreetbets;2021-03-13 22:25:50

gqu42xg;TheBearPokesYou;1;"I just went through refinancing my house because of the rates going so low. Since it was a pandemic I also didn‚Äôt want to go into a bunch of banks and talk to people. I emailed places and got on Rocket. I was weary about Rocket bc I thought it was for people who struggled to get better rates from traditional institutions. After everything was said and done, I compared all the offers I got and went with Rocket. Best decision ever. I could do everything online, I had someone who emailed me and called if I needed and walked me through and explained all the numbers. I only had one person drive to my house at the day of closing to sign all the paperwork for 15 minutes. They charged a tiny bit more but being someone that doesn‚Äôt like to deal with slick haired Bob at the bank, I decide it was worth it. 

I like the stock. I think they have a great product. Their biggest hurdle is boomers and others who thought like me in the beginning (only for people who can‚Äôt get a traditional loan). But their process was so easy, I can see this being what younger people lean towards as banks struggle to keep up with technology.

Just want to say that this is the way it‚Äôs been since January (RKT was added more recently, AMC was removed) and this is not a progressive way of preventing the market makers, banks, and hedge funds from making the trades, it is actually a way of limiting TD‚Äôs risk by offering less options to retail investors.

If I want to sell a cash secured put on GME or RKT, which are LONG positions, by the way, (bears r fuk, they pay ME the premium) I have to call, sit on the phone for an hour, and speak to a representative of the trade desk to open those positions. It‚Äôs because they‚Äôre ‚Äúhard to borrow‚Äù securities, and they want to mitigate risk.

This is nothing new, nor does it have ANY indication over what is going to happen with the stock. It is simply TD Ameritrade mitigating their risk.

Also, short interest is 20% with 20m shares shorted, and shorts have been gradually covering all week. https://i.redd.it/g7n88sv5ymm61.jpg Is it still heavily shorted? Yes. It is shorted enough to be squeezed without some HUGE moves from whales, whales that have no reason to act this week or any other week? NO.

Look, maybe I'll get some long ITM calls because I think RKT has some legitimacy as a long term hold and it's more likely to trade sideways than downward. But if you're gambling on a short term play (within the next ~2 months until earnings in May), there's literally no catalyst for another spike at all unless you think some fucking magic will happen for 3/19's quad witching hour.";wallstreetbets;2021-03-13 17:39:33

A lot of ""professionals"" were caught off-guard during the first wave/squeeze but I think its unrealistic to expect it to happen so easily again - we have lost the element of surprise.   

They understand what we are doing (I'm sure they have someone on staff to read these threads) and are in a better place to counter it.

That announcement from TD Ameritrade about customer restrictions on buying naked options on GME/RKT was very interesting.    That tells me they are worried about that method of attack but it also tells me that if they feel like they are getting trapped they can simply put pressure on brokerages or regulators to stop it akin to what happened with RH during the first squeeze.";wallstreetbets;2021-03-13 17:12:58

gqsv31q;TreeHugChamp;1;"Ummm I don‚Äôt think you understand how momentum driving works and how hedge funds take advantage of their extreme liquidity.       

Example:     
A hedge fund runs as a trading desk with 30+ different traders(high number). With $1b in liquidity that gives the traders roughly 33m each. When they go into the morning briefing, there is a list of stocks that they talk about as a team. The entire team writes down notes on the different keys that a hedge fund might look at whether it‚Äôs 5,10,15 ema and minute spacing or planned news announcements. Now with $33m each, they are all targeting the same stock, but since each trader has a different trading technique it is not considered manipulation or insider trading. For instance: you might have an options trader buying otm options at open while it drops for 5-15 minutes, then when the momentum starts to reverse you might see other traders start buying itm call options to drive the price/delta up. While all of this going on, other parties might be replicating similar moves or adding positions with buy at ask orders. After a set time frame that all the traders will be looking for as indicators of reversal, the otm options will likely sell first and cover with an extreme amount of otm puts, then everyone would attempt to drop their positions simultaneously while picking up hedges to drive the price down. Keep in mind, a hedge fund having $1b of liquidity is probably on the lower end. With $1b of liquidity and over $300m of that being used to trade options(itm and otm, while staying spread out) they can have 2-50x exposure which at $300m is a lot of leverage to have on a stock.           

To my point above: citadel released a news announcement about how they had a ton of calls, a ton of puts, and ridiculous amounts of shares in RKT. They were able to single handedly cause a gamma squeeze and mini short squeeze just buy filling position and forcing people to cover due to high risk which sent the prices sky high in aftermarket/premarket where they were subsequently able to exercise and sell their shares for profit while having the puts as a hedge, and selling the puts once they ran out of shares and hitting profit on both the upswing and down swing.           

That‚Äôs only 1 example of how hedge funds and trading desks use their positions and liquidity to take over the markets and get people to buy high and sell low. It is also how hedge funds are able to drive costs, so people get margin called when it falls. When that happens the brokerage makes tons of money because not only did they buy the stock when it was low via margin call, they can now use the position to drive the stock in whatever direction they want. The reason why you will never hear any complaints about manipulation and price driving by hedge funds is because the broker like schwab or robinhood make immense amounts of money when their clients get margin called and the broker can diamond hand their way to gains because they have an inside track on direction. Look up how much brokerages earn from margin trading and margin calls, not related to margin loans.";wallstreetbets;2021-03-13 14:35:51

We will all make money. UWMC under 8 &amp; RKT under 25 (30 is ok too) are great prices. UWMC is cheaper per share. I really like that.

Usually when a company starts issuing a regular dividend it means they have stopped or slowed growth, have cash since there is no expansion or acquisitions planned and need something to do with it.

gqquj8x;Megahuts;1;"They are the largest mortgage originator in the USA, with 10% of the market.

They are taking so much market share from competitors that UWMC had it issue an ultimatum to the independent mortgage brokers on Facebook: You have to sign that you won't use RKT. 

Their side businesses are growing gangbusters too. 

The US housing market is going through a MASSIVE boom. There are housing shortages everywhere, which means lots of new construction. 

By buying RKT, you are betting on the continued strength of the US housing market. 

That is a bet I will take any day, based on current market conditions. (2008 was a long time ago now).

Hell, they 10x their profits last year. 

The squeeze was (largely) squoze, so I expect it to trade sideways, and grow based on fundamentals. 

Personally, I could see this being a $100 per share stock in 5-10 years.

gqqd5so;a_bit_condescending;2;"There may be a downward trend over the last month, but this stock has a real catalyst coming up with it's index inclusions.  In the mid-term, Q1 and Q2 should yield massive earnings, which could lead to a dividend increase and/or a special dividend payout.  Long-term outlook is as-good or better than any other mortgage company as they are utilizing and further developing tools to shorten closing periods and lower closing costs.  And if they build a record of regular dividend payouts they could easily be included in dividend funds.

Real short term catalysts, realistic potential mid-term catalysts, and good long term prospects for growth on a dividend stock with a cheap entry point, seems like a good buy to me.  I don't see why this would be trading at 1/3 of the price per share of RKT, especially when looming interest rate hikes are more dire news for RKT than UWMC.

Nokia (My biggest Value Play)

I am not so sure on the Nokia 5 calls...as this is not really shorted... But then again, Nok had a high today 4.21 and sitting at 4.17 today (In line with Nokia.HE as it closed at $3.50 Euros).  William Barr (AG) wrote a fantastic speech on China 5G Domination vs. Rest of World and specifically state we should invest heavily in Nokia and Ericcson. (This was also last year, but momentum has already shifted).

RKT

Completely agree with you on Rocket.. Highly manipulated stock since inception.  I agree that this has wings.  The buy back is key I think to remove the shorts and sky rocket.  Fantastic earnings for 2020 and 2021 outlook.

AMC 

Also agree - I am in some mid leap calls.  Whether meme or not, this company has value.  I am with you on, wanting to get the heck out of my house to watch a movie at a theatre.  

&amp;#x200B;

The March 19th date (calls right before that) are a bit risky for me.  I would assume the HF/MM are already doing strategies to protect themselves... Then again, I am hoping for all of these to grow substantially!

Last quarter we started to see it happen with Homes and Auto. This is just the beginning, they are building an Amazon-esque platform that will expand their revenue streams and allow them to toggle margins in the different areas to grow share in the areas they choose without taking as much of an overall hit.

When the market gets hit, this is when that plan will spring into action. Plus they are making so much money now that they can afford more squeezing when the market goes bad to keep growing share while others struggle.

gqpi6rd;MST_RK_P2;1;"Your ""research"" is a self-serving press-release, issued by the company. Hard hitting.

UWM has 35% market share in the broker channel, which was fueled by the proprietary tech you mention (which helped them close loans quicker in 2020 when that was at a premium) and them buying the market with aggressive pricing ahead of going public. While there are certainly a lot of small broker shops that send all their business to UWM that are drinking the UWM Kool Aid that immediately bent the knee and signed the addendum, the majority of UWM's ""active clients"" are not selling to just UWM. Anyone that believes that 90% of all brokers are going to sign away their right to do business with the #2 market share buyer (that took a ton of business from UWM in the fall and winter) and another emerging player is just idiocy to anyone that really knows this industry. As is thinking ""registered companies"" don't fudge unprovable stats in interviews.

In terms of UWM underwriting loans differently than RKT, that is just flat out false and a completely uninformed statement. Both RKT and UWM are nothing more than middle men, underwriting to Fannie/Freddie/Ginnie guidelines. They hold no loans. All loans they close are immediately sold, underwritten to the same conservative guidelines that spawned from Dodd/Frank post-mortgage meltdown. UWM's proprietary software and app is slick. And so is Rockets. And all their competitors are gaining ground on the tech edge they used to grow market share and go public. None of this tech has anything to do with ""underwriting loans for individual mortgage brokers"" or being more in touch with the common man.

While Ishbia early on did use public bickering with Rocket to help gain name recognition and market share, he poked the bear. Rocket was never even really into the wholesale channel at all until a few years ago, and their market share was minimal until recently.

gqoprcx;calipfarris01;1;No problem and yeah I'm in a constant battle with myself on if I would rather own the shares or own leaps on the shares if I'm long.  The leaps typically have more leverage so the returns are greater, but also more risk with the time decay. Owning the shares outright allows me to leverage my investment by lending them out (covered calls) but has the risk of the SP dropping in value.  I will typically buy stocks on a company I'm very long on (RKT for instance) and buy leaps on a company I see short term growth with (usually in the 4-6 month range).  I'm sure there is a way to leverage owning the leaps as well I just haven't gotten there yet.;stocks;2021-03-12 13:13:34

gqon1bk;Boomtown626;1;"If you did your DD, you should have a price target and timeframe. If you find yourself unsure of what to do with 10% gains on your hands, your DD is sorely lacking and needs to be improved. Also, based on the last few weeks of volatility, if your process involves buying or selling based on 10% swings, DD is completely pointless. You're gambling on market timing, not investing in a company.  

For the companies I hold, 10% gains just means I have a buffer zone to keep my holdings safe from red territory through the next selloff day. If I don't have a price target in mind, it's because I'm going to be ride or die with that company for a year or three based on the belief it could double or triple or more in that time.

gqnt8of;Stoke-me-a-clipper;1;"Hi. I‚Äôm still learning about selling calls so I‚Äôm trying to understand your math here. Can you tell me if I‚Äôve got this right?

You own 2000 RKT with at $19.47 cost basis, and it has been hovering around $25 lately ‚Äî those shares have about a ($5.52 x 2000) = $11K value currently. You say you make $3K/week selling covered calls for RKT at $28 strike. 

I checked prices and it looks like I could sell a 1 week contract at $28 strike for about $116. 

With 2000 shares, you can sell 20 1-week calls for $116 each and as long as no one exercises, you‚Äôd get (20 x $116) = $2320 per week.

If it never hits $22, I keep the premium I sold the call for and keep my 100 shares. Rinse and repeat.

gqnfry0;Jorycle;2;"I'm not expecting to be successful in getting you guys off the UWMC train anymore, but every one of these things is an example of how bad graphs can paint a deceptive picture.

Example one: You guys salivate over ""massive crashes"" and ""huge spikes"" on these graphs, and the implications of what those sneaky shorters are doing. It's a difference of *pennies*, but looks big because the stock is so flat, and any flat line looks crazy under a microscope. The high today was 8.84. The low was 8.45. The contracts are at 9 and 7.5. It didn't even break into a different tier.

Example two: You guys salivate over ""massive"" short interest by quoting a specific number of shares, a couple million. UWMC has 1.6 billion shares. It's not a significantly shorted company. It's impossible to find a list of highly shorted companies that includee UWMC because it's not really much higher than the median. It's hard to squeeze something that doesn't have much juice in it to begin with. 

Perspective is important when evaluating this stuff. You need to look at the bigger picture to see the context of your data.

UWMC spiked to 12 because people who missed out on RKT, and people who got burned by the RKT halts and market open crash, scattered to the nearest competitor. UWMC did a media tour begging for this attention. 95% of the posts on this sub about it were from bots. *Jim Cramer*, king of pump and dumps and fucking with the market, helped push it, too.

I know it's upsetting to hear, and feel free to keep your stuff in UWMC if you're planning for long term growth (I don't know if UWMC has that either, but stocks only go up right?). But if you're planning for rocket ships, UWMC is going to disappoint.";wallstreetbets;2021-03-12 03:11:34

I do think HMPT will get a nice business bounce as some brokers just say fuck it and look for another option.

gqn03u6;causeoffaction;2;"You make a good point. In that depriving the rest of the market is a factor when it approaches a complete shut-out. Consider though that the FTC guidance's ideal examples use goods as the supply chain and market entrants as those most likely to be harmed. Here it seems harder to show brokers as goods easily shuffled away from competitors, and RKT is a big boy here--entering the cage and getting knocked out is different than being able to enter in the first place, which is why I said that an upstart mortgage company with no geographic reach would fit your approach a lot better.

Litigation is impossible to predict but, when the FTC guidance presumes the legality of a type of agreement, it's a toughie, and you'd want those exceptional details to be clear. I'm impressed by RKT's response, and it makes sense to not bring up the legal side until they can show harm (which they'd need to do) and that only happens in the future if UWM monopolizes the market to a pretty unsettling degree. In which case yeah, it'll probably turn into a legal battle. To your point, the legal challenge doesn't even have to win, it just needs to provide leverage through the lawsuit itself or via settlement.

Pros:

\- New index listing soon ( Russel 1000/3000 March 21st, so a short term play for that reason. Prices go up a bit when newly listed)- Many brokers (if not the majority) prefer them over RKT.

\- As Covid begins to settle, and mortgage interest rates begin to climb back to normal, it's speculated that UWMC will remain the preferred provider.

Cons:

\- Although many people agree, many people also disagree, with the CEO's recent ""attack"" against RKT, stating that anyone that works with them, cannot also work with UWMC.   
The reaction to this is pretty split down the middle from what I've seen so far.

\- It's currently being suppressed. Not sure why. It's gaining a lot of traction on social media, yet the price is remaining pretty stale the past few days.

Once in that index, the index fund will basically be on the hook to buy shares, thereby raising the price as the big fish enters. Personally I like RKT long term and UWMC for the next 1-2 years tops.

I want to make sure it's a quality stock though, one I don't mind holding on to for a while and that I can hopefully buy even more of with any gains. I was thinking about RKT since its price has settled to about what it was before it was memeified, it seems to have quality earnings, it's a mortgage company in a real estate boom, and the volatility means there's some juicy premiums on dolo. The downside is the underlying could still fall a lot if it's still riding on some meme magic, but I'm willing to take the risk, especially if I can hedge the investment with some bi-weekly premiums in the meantime. Maybe I should start off with cash covered puts instead so I stand a chance of getting the shares for a good price?;investing;2021-03-11 08:37:15

The spreads are super close so you don‚Äôt have to worry too much about that.  Find strike/expirations with a lot of OI.  That helps with the spread.  There are literally shit tons of videos on youtube to learn about trading options.  Investopedia.com has a lot of literature to read also.   Good luck!  

And I second what the other guy said about ‚Äúfor every gain post-there are hundreds of losses‚Äù. I‚Äôve made a few decent gains on GME options but erased the fuck out of my last one with a $RKT yolo.  

Best thing I can tell you is to get the gist of options-do your homework and figure out what you want to buy and what you‚Äôre risking-pick your entry and fucking hold on.  Option prices can fluctuate wildly.   Pick a comfortable exit (loss or gain).  It can always be ALOT worse or better.";wallstreetbets;2021-03-11 07:39:52

gqjd95r;danielitsme;1;"$RKT - QUAD Witching ; expiring options 3/19. Short options are expiring, so if calls sold with strikes in the money will lead to HF/MM/short sellers scrambling to cover their position or buy more calls to hedge. More calls bought at the money will lead to more shares bought by MM.

Quad-Witching is on 3/19. Meanings options are expiring, so if shorted calls with strike in-the-money will lead to HF/MM/Short sellers to hedge by buying more calls, or buying more shares. As pressure progress above $26.80 (adjusted for $1.11 Div) we will have huge volatility. If you can't afford too mayn shares, Call options at-the-money with at least .40 delta will continue to boost pressure and price of shares. 

There are 37,576 3/19 $28.89 calls bought today, we need to apply pressure to get it over $28.89. Can you imagine how much MM would need to hedge with shares ? That‚Äôs (.36 delta)* 37,576= 1,352,736 shares they have to buy which is $35mm. How can this been done ? Buying 3/19 $25.89 calls, if those blow up in volume you will see a squeeze that will trickle down. Let me know if I‚Äôm wrong or missing anything. 

This is not financial advice, I'm speculating, ask Vlad's wife's boyfriend for advice. Upvote this, let it be known; the squeeze will commence!

"" Real World Example of Quadruple Witching

Friday, March 15, 2019, was the first quadruple witching day of 2019. The frenzy leading up to Friday during that week led to increased market activity. However, it's uncertain as to whether the witching leads to increased gains in the market since it's impossible to separate any gains due to expiring options and futures from gains due to other factors such as earnings and economic events.‚Äù";wallstreetbets;2021-03-11 05:27:46

If you sold the option, theta would chip away at the value of the option, so you could close your position and make the premium- buyback.

gqg2sw1;ionized_fallout;1;"07:20 AM EST, 03/10/2021 (MT Newswires) -- Gamestop(GME) shares were up 16% pre-bell Wednesday, continuing their rally of several days, supported by the news of the appointment of Ryan Cohen to lead the company's shift to e-commerce.

Other wallstreetbets Reddit stocks were mixed. AMC (AMC) followed suit trading up 7%, and Blackberry (BB) was up 2%, while Nokia(NOK) was up 2% and Palantir(PLTR) was inching toward 1% up early Wednesday.

Other wallstreetbets Reddit stocks were down Wednesday pre-bell, including Tesla (TSLA) that traded slightly lower and UWMC that was down 1%. Rocket Cos(RKT). (RKT) was also slightly down, and so were Advanced Micro Devices(AMD) and Apple(AAPL) .

gqf3quw;bakamito;1;"I had a bunch of links as I was doing research on RKT and UWMC, but I can't find them right now. But I found a couple via google:

""Like Rocket, UWM is having a big couple of years as borrowers take advantage of low interest rates by refinancing their mortgages. Loan origination volume grew from $42 billion in 2018 to $108 billion last year, and is projected to hit $200 billion in 2020. The company‚Äôs net income went from $67 million in 2018 to $303 million in 2019 and it expects to earn $2.1 billion this year. Company projections are for origination volume to hit $240 billion in 2022 while earnings slip to $1.8 billion.

Ishbia is bullish not only on UWM‚Äôs ability to grow its market share, but also on the growth of the wholesale mortgage business as a whole‚Äîespecially once rock-bottom interest rates begin to rise. The company forecasts the wholesale channel‚Äôs share of the overall mortgage market growing to 33% by 2026, up from 20% in 2019 and 15% in 2016. While the current low-interest rate-driven boom in refis has been a boon for mortgage originators, Ishbia says UWM is poised to succeed as rate-sensitive refinance business dies down and home buyers seek out brokers for help obtaining a mortgage. ""

Currently they have around 35% percent of mortgage brokers, I think they grew from 32 in 2019, and something like 28 in 2018. If I find my original research I will link it.

There was a industry analysis I had a link to but can't find it right now:

I haven't spoken to a real estate agent yet, but the impression I have been getting from reading CEO interviews is:

UWMC CEO is more slow and focused (one segement at a time),
while RKT CEO is agressive and wants to expand within multiple areas at the same time.

gqeyq3r;memyselfandirony;1;RKT is one of my all-time greats: originally bought in around the first big run up post IPO, blinded by the rocket emojis and honestly not realizing it was ER day (I‚Äôm fairly new to stock investing). Of course, share price plummeted the next day. I resigned myself to bagholding, but did eventually DCA down from the low $30s to the mid-$20s. And I eventually realized I like the stock. Enough that I didn‚Äôt sell in the recent pump and dump, even though I would have doubled my money. Maybe that was dumb, but I think the stock is a good long-term hold. And now I have enough shares to sell a covered call.

gqd72zd;TechnicianPlenty;1;"At a certain point 99% of the money is going to take their profits and leave; the goal post for that has moved so much. I lurked this sub very infrequently pre-GME; and I made(percentage wise) lots of money from it. Lots from RKT. But, I've also lost money on some rocket options for not selling them when I was way up; hoping for more because of the supposed friday rally. I also watched most of my money disappear in the dive to 45 on GME. I've missed out on lots of potential money, that I held in my hands, because I didn't sell over hype.

I should have sold at 400. I cancelled my limits b/c I was super hyped of this ultra short. Cheating or no: that got fucked. I'm thrilled it went back up; and I got to take profits like I should have originally.

I'm all in that this is a gamble. But, it really is starting to feel like it's not a gamble, it's not hedgefund money, it's regular people. The DD doesn't feel solid anymore: for this price. $100 I'd give the benefit of the doubt. Gamma squeeze/short squeeze/whatever: I'm smooth brained, but I don't see evidence of a short squeeze coming. I see this crashing hard again while everyone types ""hold"" and ""paper hands""; and then it jumps again: ad infinitum. Until there's not enough regular people overpaying for GME.

GME will probably have swings for another five years because of the massive worldwide hype. Some people will lose money on it, some will make lots, some will buy at a peak that isnt seen again for a year(s).
I just learned that if you're up 1,000%: that's plenty: take your winnings; because 200% is beating the market dramatically and is life changing money. 1,000% is hopes and dreams: and lots of people make their money off of your hopes and dreams.

I will be -thrilled- if I'm wrong. Hedge funds crash and burn. The market is shaken up. And a bunch of regular people are thrust into wealth. No sour grapes; I'll be ecstatic. I just don't see this squeezing anymore; which means it's taking regular peoples money who bought the hype. It's hedgefunds making money off our dreams and desperation.";wallstreetbets;2021-03-09 19:58:19

gqcxbbz;Verb0182;1;"Its pretty much irrelevant. 

Hedge funds ‚Äúneed to cover‚Äù for 2 reasons:
1) their borrow gets recalled or becomes just too expensive. This is actually super super super rare. Look at RkT. High SI, 50% borrow cost, special dividend, HFs don‚Äôt GAF. That spike was hype/ gamma probably very few covered. 

2) they lose too much money and they get equivalent of margin called. Typically this involves losing money on both sides of the book like what happened in January. 

Managing short positions is very difficult for one big reason- as your trade goes against you it gets bigger. 

Ex: 
Go long XYZ 5% of your portfolio. You‚Äôre wrong, it doesn‚Äôt work out, Stock down 40% the trade shrinks itself to 3% 

Go short ABC -5% of your portfolios. You‚Äôre wrong, stock goes up 40%, uh oh it‚Äôs now a -7% position.  They literally have to keep buying just to keep the position the same size. 

Anyway, if your shorts make a huge move  against you and your longs also are down it‚Äôs a disaster. Your capital has declined while your shorts are ballooning. Literally have to keep buying and buying and buying.
GME would not have played out the way it did in January if a bunch of other short names weren‚Äôt also up and a bunch of popular HF longs weren‚Äôt also down. 

**ANYWAY** if the HF is short through an ETF neither of these apply. The borrow isn‚Äôt getting recalled nor is it super expensive. And the ETF price movement isn‚Äôt extreme enough to force covering.
You ask ‚Äúwhat if they shorted the ETF and bought all the other stocks to stay short GME‚Äù? 1) this is convoluted and expensive I doubt anyone did this. 2) that doesn‚Äôt help you. It IS synthetic meaning their borrow won‚Äôt be recalled. They won‚Äôt really be ‚Äúforced‚Äù to cover";wallstreetbets;2021-03-09 18:44:29

UWMC went to bat for brokers saying they had enough of this  unethical stuff going on as they only work with brokers.  I'm hearing well over 90% of brokers bent the knee for UWMC and told RKT to sod off (only makes sense since their interests are aligned here).  UWMC processes loans much faster and has a much better relationship with brokers...UWMC has already won this battle.

Lucked out and sold my calls on the rocket up to $40 and down to $30. Still have 250 shares and 3 contracts but I'm playing with house money now and will at a minimum 3x my investment. So reddit has benefits. But the blindly following and never locking in profits is going to bankrupt a lot of people.

At the end of the day the average investor underperforms the market because they follow the heard and trade with emotion.

gqcdvut;OldSoul-YoungLibido;3;"Reddit is becoming a little hive minded in their stock picks. Which is annoying if you are looking for diamonds in the rough but it offers a great opportunity, especially with stimulus checks coming.

I've been taking advantage of the high IV by going long on growth stocks that I like and then selling weekly way OTM covered calls. Finding that I can sell a CC on a meme stock with a strike price 25% OTM and still get a hefty premium. I like these stocks so I'm okay with the volatility on the underline security and those weekly CCs are great cash flow. I also don't care if it gets assigned. I'm selling CCs 25% OTM so if it gets assigned I made 25% on the security in one week + the CC premium. If I still like the security I'll just do weekly Cash Covered Puts until it gets assigned as a way to again benefit from the volatility and hopefully buy it at a low.

Today's moves:
Swing trading NRGU
Selling weekly far OTM covered calls for meme stocks I'm long (PLTR, RKT, FUBO)

gqbmyv1;Life-Cricket1898;1;"So

I don't have anything in RKT

I did however predict this first squeeze right, and pulled out my accounts almost at the top, leveraging more Tendies, going all in GME/ AMC.

What I would say is pull up a three month overview of RKT, and sundial and observe. Then pull up GME and AMC and tell me if you see any familiar patterns (And what is a rough time frame between squeezes), As of now RKT is following a second squeeze trend. I'm not a fortune teller, though considering the 5% dividend coming up I'm sure it has a better then decent shot. Only time will tell as the chart matures, hopefully it won't devolve into a dead cat bounce...

This is if you want to hold it for the long term. As for me I know no one's going to hold much longer (fomo) considering we're in the stages of GME short squeeze (I believe we're leaving the gamma phase). GME is beyond ""UNIQUE"", we may have a chance of breaking the pattern if it continues to go up past the 19th it will (should) go into the 100k realm if so (yea crazy I know). In my position I'm watching this like a hawk non- stop for a lot of people (placed their accounts all in). If I'm doing this perhaps we can use a little common sense and figure out the odds/ avs of how many people have x amount of $$$ in these positions... You can get that number from looking at the WSB user's added in the last months (throw common sense out the window of what this stock should be valued at).

I'm planning on leveraging either way from one squeeze to another and it's good if RKT takes a few weeks to mature sideways. It'll take that long for GME unique squeeze to go through anyway... This is my perspective of the moment and the forecast always... ALWAYS CHANGES. 

                               -Not finical advice-

As for me I like the stock, and wish you the best of luck.

He met my grandmother because her family owned a store and gave his extra food when their father was too drunk to work. Because of his early experiences, my grandfather was famously cheap when it came to himself, but he spent on his family. He was missing teeth purely because he didn't think he'd be alive long enough to justify a visit to the dentist. He passed away a little under 2 weeks ago, 2 days after I finally started seeing green in my account again. I was emotionally wrecked and in a panic attack I sold to lock in my gains. Then, the next trading day I bought back in and used my gains to buy a couple more shares. I missed out on $12 of growth, but oh well. I was so nervous on the flight to his funeral that I couldn't look at my portfolio that I almost got sick on the plane. The day of, I thought about pulling out of GME and jumping into RKT for some quick gains that I could stick back into GME later. I said a prayer for him and I asked his advice in front of the casket. I got the feeling that I should keep holding. And now here we are...

Turns out he gave pretty good financial advice.";wallstreetbets;2021-03-09 12:25:53

How it works for most money-losers: you buy GME for 120, wait 1-2 weeks and think that it is dead, no movement at all. Then you see RKT suddendly moving to the moon, buy RKT at 30-40 and it drops, but GME moves to the 200, then people can sell RKT at loss for 25 and buy 200-250$ GME that can drop and story will repeat until you lose all your money.

gqarwih;DothrakAndRoll;1;"They're in a super dramatic feud rn. UWMC has 22% of the mortgage broker market and last Thursday (3/4) issued an ultimatum stating they wouldn't do business with brokers doing business with RKT. Very out there and some say may not even be legal. 

UWMC claims RKT is giving brokers a raw deal. RKT says UWMC is limiting buyer's choices and limiting free market with their ultimatum.

So what happens now? It's hard to say. There are people on either side of the fence. RKT has their stupid dividend. But a lot of people consider the UWMC CEO's ultimatum unethical. But, that won't likely stop brokers from choosing them when they have 75 other options from RKT that are near as good (or some cases better).

gq9uc21;JustANyanCat;2;"Thanks so much for your comment. 

&gt;Read employee reviews on indeed. They're awful. Compare salaries to national. It can all be remote these days, so they'll look elsewhere. 

I usually take online employee reviews with a pinch of salt because it often varies from person to person, but I will still take what I've just seen in the negative reviews into consideration. 

&gt;There will be a huge rush, then volume will drop off a fucking cliff. I'm talking 50-80%. They'll eat a few months before they cut staffing. Net income will plummet. 

&gt;They will likely do very well for the next 6- 9 months regardless of interest rates. But if rates do rise to 4.5-5%, 50% or more of revenue will vanish within 4-6 months of hitting that rate. 

I'll watch out for these too. My investment horizon for UWMC is about 1-6 months or hitting a profit of 20-30% (my average cost is $8.73), so I should be out before that happens.

Now with a whopping $150-180 GME range, the shorting fee is at a paltry 1.7%?

I'm using this as a general parallel: I interpret this as a barriers from price appreciation slowly being lifted off of RKT since the fee was in the 80% range last week and now it's coming down to 25%. There are now 1,000,000 shares available to borrow versus just 50 shares last week at one point.

If they provide proof they actually yolod into that people can be like damn da fuq. 

GME is a weird beast right now because we all are aware with what is going on and the amount of DD on this sub that provides information. So people here are most likely holding.

I kept being told I was dumb to sell but I only bought it for a move I believed in and the move didn't happen. 

I didn't know enough about the company to feel comfortable holding long term. Value play or not. Plus as interest rates move up people will overreact to any companies with mortgage exposure.

[Here's another comment with more details about what's going on between UWMC and RKT](https://www.reddit.com/r/UWMCShareholders/comments/lyk06u/quick_dd_of_rkt_vs_uwmc_a_war_between_brokers_and/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share).

UWMC is just targeting the wholesale market, while RKT does both wholesale and retail. [RKT did some shady things in 2017 where they would take steal the clients from the brokers for the retail divisions. This led to the Brokers Rallying Against Whole-tail Lending (BRAWL) initiative, which aimed to stop such practices. UWM has shown support for the brokers in this initiative.](https://www.housingwire.com/articles/41517-mortgage-brokers-launch-brawl-initiative-to-combat-unethical-whole-tail-lender-practices/)

The part that you said about ""UWMC is so scared of them that they are threatening to cut off doing business with ANYONE that works with RKT"" doesn't seem like the case to me. [Check out their Facebook statement regarding that announcement.](https://m.facebook.com/UnitedWholesaleMortgage/photos/a.106487631999/10157497180352000/?type=3&amp;source=48&amp;ref=page_internal) UWMC seems very confident that they can beat RKT for the wholesale side, as they seem to have a good relationship with the broker community.

Also, UWMC is also going to be in the Russell 1000 and 3000 index on March 22nd, which is the date that I'm looking at. 

While I think that RKT is a good stock, I have already hit my price target for it and am going to buy another stock that I also think is a good stock.

The company recently saw a solid Q4 earnings report that led to an uptick in the stock. Then the Wall Street Bets crew noticed the short interest, which cause a massive spike in the stock.

gq68smw;aka0007;1;"Honestly, no idea.

I think the market is increasingly adapting to the reality a group like wsb poses. Shorts, including those needing to cover calls, learned the hard way with GME when they delayed covering and by now they might be covering much faster. There may not be a possibility of a squeeze left. I am beginning to wonder if we can rely on any squeeze by any other company at this time, due to the changing market conditions.

Basically, I am left with making assumptions about why there is a decent case based on value for the price to move, rather then focusing on the squeeze anymore. Should have realized this sooner and would have made a lot more money (between fully cashing out on RKT and not dumping money in UWMC).";wallstreetbets;2021-03-08 03:27:17

gq621zt;BrotherLuminous;1;ü§î I guess my point still stands that we are at the crux of short leverage unless the data changed on Friday, should the price increase and forced covering is initiated the MM would still have to obtain an extra 1.7 million shares from the market that would be attributed to MM themselves.. Past this point shorting becomes more and more risky and thus expensive ....  I'm starting to understand the leeway they have about it but I.

Something similar happened with RKT. 

It seems to me that if its hedge funds they're adapting their style from fighting against us via aggressive shorting - as they used to - to taking long positions in already popular stocks and using the new, inexperienced members to pump for them. 

Recently its been a repeat of the same formula:
- Dozens of posts and tens of thousands of comments to stir interest and fomo.
- Shortly thereafter people fomo in after hours and premarket when halts can't happen.
- Stock dumps the next morning immediately at open, regardless of market conditions.
