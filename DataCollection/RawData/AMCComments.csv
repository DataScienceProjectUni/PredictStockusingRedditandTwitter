gr8t9q5;enter57chambers;3;"1 big thing: Wall Street's ""smart money"" is still betting stocks fall

Having been battered and bruised by the broad rally in stocks this year and the meme stock resurgence, bearish investors are holding onto and even increasing their short bets, wagering even more money that stocks like GameStop and AMC will sink along with the broader market.

Background: Hedge funds got burned on short positions earlier this year as meme stocks jumped by hundreds of percentage points in just weeks, and then scrambled to reduce risk and square their positions.

That precipitated hedge funds‚Äô largest week of de-leveraging since February 2009, according to data from Goldman Sachs‚Äô prime brokerage unit, CNBC noted.
Yes, but: ""No one is capitulating,"" Ihor Dusaniwsky, managing director of predictive analytics at S3 Partners, tells Axios.

""Hedge funds that are in these big mover names, they tell me: 'I‚Äôm not getting out of this trade. I just had to cut my shares because the stock price went up so much.'""
""'I‚Äôm taking losses, but I think this f---er‚Äôs going back down to 10 bucks. I‚Äôm going to win eventually; it‚Äôs just a matter of me having the backbone to stay with the trade.'""
Case in point: Short sellers increased their bearish bets against companies that have gone public through special purpose acquisition vehicles (SPACs) to more than triple their value at the start of the year, rising to about $2.7 billion from $724 million, WSJ reported Sunday, citing S3 Partners' data.

But it's not just SPACs that these short sellers ‚Äî mainly hedge funds ‚Äî are targeting. They're increasingly putting down bets that broader indexes, like the S&amp;P 500, the Nasdaq and the Russell 3000 will decline.
By the numbers: Short bets against the S&amp;P rose 10.2% from the end of 2020 to March 15, touching a recent high of $521.1 billion, S3's data show.

Short interest as a percentage of the S&amp;P's total float declined by 7.8% during that time.
""Traders are betting one $100 chip on the short side instead of five $10 dollar chips,"" Dusaniwsky says.
The bottom line: Having amassed searing losses and public embarrassment and facing a euphoric bull market, Wall Street's so-called smart money continues to pile into short bets and has shown no sign of stopping or even slowing down.";wallstreetbets;2021-03-17 15:14:23

gr8sov4;Vertical_Monkey;1;"The more I learn, the more I find out that these youtubers are using outdated info, or have gaps in their knowledge, or are letting bias cloud their judgement (I'm giving a lot of benefit of the doubt here) of stocks they're heavily invested in.

AMC was an amazing recovery play, and there's probably still an amount of short term upside. Whether that's just the greater fool theory playing out amongst retail with big players scalping on the way, we probably won't know until it's long over. There might even be room for long term upside, but you need to figure out your own risk tolerance and if long term there's enough wiggle room to mitigate the large risk in the short term.

GME is the perfect storm. It seems like the pressure is still bubbling under the surface. Again, we might have seen the squeeze, and you'd need to do the same calculations there. There are a lot more things in favour of a long term increase to mitigate the risk of no squeeze in my opinion, and a lot of DD highlighting them. 

Tl;dr - You need to manage your risk, and the more you learn, the more you'll realise that YouTube really is purely for entertainment. 

A good place to learn fundamental analysis is actually Roaring Kitty's YouTube channel. Even doing 10% of the research he does will probably put you ahead of 90% of investors.";wallstreetbets;2021-03-17 15:09:52

Save your stimi, if you have no choice but to invest put it in a retirement. If you can afford to waste it then od what you please but dont panic buy.

gr8ab83;subsetsum;1;"I own 2000 shares of AMC. I'm an AMC A-list member and go to the movies a few times a week and always buy tendies and tip well. I love AMC. but this stock is not GME. GME was an highly unusual situation that had several catalysts including Ryan cohen and the potential to transform digitally. AMC is more of a recovery play and it is not going to the moon but could eventually go to 20. A lot of people on this sub have no idea what they are talking about. The hedge funds really don't care about us and they can make money if the stock goes up or down. They have billions of dollars to trade with and can play by rules unavailable to us. Also people can have both AMC and GME, I do.

If you want to buy AMC, wait for a dip. I think it's a great company to hold longer term but don't buy it hoping for a rocket. I'm in at an average price of 8 which isn't great but still gives a chance for upside. I also have more serious money in theme park stocks but I've been in for awhile and saw my investment do pretty well. SIX was $8 last March and is now around 50. I have 50 call options at 40 expiring Friday too, this was something I bought because I know the company and it was beaten down last year due to the pandemic and I held waiting for recovery. 

So my advice is to buy a few stocks that will grow longer term, maybe read about ETFs, follow cathie wood. Look for something that's beaten down now or has real potential to grow long term, maybe a stock that pays good dividends. 

In short, you can buy AMC, not saying not to, I love AMC, but don't expect a rocket. and yes, learning to invest will help you build wealth long term so good for you.";wallstreetbets;2021-03-17 12:26:51

But in short...

The short interest as a percentage of float isn't high enough. The float is too high. The float has a *high* degree of risk of being diluted further by 500m shares.

And there is still fundamental uncertainty about the longterm health of AMC, due to its debt position... meaning short positions are under no real pressure to buy back any of those shares.";wallstreetbets;2021-03-17 11:47:10

This is to induce that AMC is the way and GME is dying, which is actually not true. While AMC still has potential for a squeeze, it is unlikely due to the number of shares/float and so on, while GME is way more likely to see a squeeze.

His $3 valuation also seems pretty generous to me when you look at it's pre-craze pricing and consider the dilution's effect. 


The literal only thing keeping this stock from crashing back to $3 is the volume from retards overpaying for it, expecting it to spike for poorly thought out reasons. 


I mean if you don't mind the risk and want to get on to ride the volatility, go for it. But timing this shit isn't gonna be easy and you are going to be a bag holder for sure if you don't even realize the situation. Calling it a casino play seems accurate to me.

I plan on putting a couple hundred from our stim checks in because I‚Äôve been doing well and that‚Äôs money I could lose without shorting us anywhere. As for AMC, for my position I‚Äôm going to be happy if it gets above $20 which I think it can easily do. I‚Äôd be surprised if it went above $30 so I‚Äôll likely sell somewhere in there and reinvest once the price drops back down because I do like the stock and my husband and I have always seen AMC as one of our biggest date places, so it has a bit of sentimental value and I want to see it do well and show support. Idk I see all this stuff about squeezed and to the moon, and while I‚Äôve bought some of each of those stocks for fun and to watch what happens I have never put in a large amount on them thinking I‚Äôll make it big. I don‚Äôt have the thousands many of those big winners had to initially invest, and if I did it isn‚Äôt money I could have tied up for months just waiting and hoping for the moon.

gr7qpg3;innatestead;1;I hope AMC works out for you and your family. But just take your time and don't rush, there will be plenty of opportunities.

gr7qmyq;Techno__Violet;1;"But the shorts are not significant for any special reason. The huge financial firms shorting AMC are doing it because a room full of professionals decided it was a profitable play. 

GME is special due the sheer magnitude of how much of it is shorted, and the questionable reporting with institutional investors reporting 115% of total shares ever issued, among other factors that are beyond my understanding. 

My hypothesis is that BB, NOK, and partially AMC came into play because they were all heavily shorted, and much more affordable than GME at the ""tipping point"" when GME first exploded and there was an influx of millions of users/traders buying in late game, and to the novice trader - buying 100 shares of a $4 stock is more psychologically satisfying than buying two shares of a $200 stock. 

The human dimension drives this whole train, not reason or logic. GME is the only legitimate player here (squueze business) and it is not guaranteed to do anything.

gr7k39x;Fwellimort;1;" Look. You will see many winners in life over something so trivial.

Life isn't all fair. But both you and I KNOW deep inside that the odds of such event occurring to you is VERY VERY low.

There's constantly lottery winners around the world. There's constantly people who make jackpots in casinos. There's constantly.. you get the idea. But NONE of them are the norm.

For instance, the wsb subreddit has some people who made $1k to $700k\~2 million. But guess what, that sub has almost 10 million people. And many more that follow the sub but aren't subscribed (like me).

Even if 100 people posted unrealistic winnings, that's out of 10 million people so like:

0.001% of people.

Don't lose everything to pray you are that &lt; 0.001%. Gambling is the best way to dig yourself to a financially worse position.

The winning solution to traditional investing is long term. Buy a well diversified broad market fund like VTI and hold for a lifetime unless you truly believe you know more than all the professionals (with many phds from schools like Princeton/MIT working 100 hrs a day to juice out 'a bit more' of money) in Wall Street long term.

And in meantime, invest in your family and yourself. Making yourself more marketable and spending proper time with your loved ones is what you should do. Try your best to make sure you don't regret your decisions 10 years later.

Hindsight is always 20/20. We all missed the next gamestop, bitcoin, amc, penn, tesla, etc. Guess what though. Those happen so regularly so who cares. Last year was Tesla. Previous year was bitcoin. You get the idea? There's always opportunities out there. Stop FOMO-ing and be realistic.

Making money from stock market is literally making money out of thin air. Why should you be rewarded more than anyone else for doing no work but getting yourself entertained through gambling?";stocks;2021-03-17 05:43:58

gr6ytgr;Unlucky_Falcon1754;1;"Very true. This started as a thought experiment asking what would it look like if a single hypothetical market maker was on the short side of all of these options. We know that it is not what happens and that most market makers are probably doing a good job staying delta neutral. But I have the open interest data and I have MS Excel so I've been bored enough to track it. 

The only interesting thing that I have found is that for nearly every other stock I've looked at--save for AMC at some points--the minimum exposure point tends to be very close to the market price. There may be deviations for some of the weeklies that are a bit out with not a lot of open interest, but for (1) the next weekly and (2) the next monthly, it's the minimum exposure point for that series is basically the nearest strike price to the last closing price. 

GME and AMC are the exceptions to what I've found. I don't pretend to know what this all means. At first glance, one would think that they'd want the price to go to 155, but the short side of the options would still be exposed to 824 million from 924 million (based on 220.14/share). That's a 100 million difference, but what would it cost this hypothetical market maker who has the short side of everything (let's call him Ken for short) to push the share price of GME from 220.14 to 155?";wallstreetbets;2021-03-17 01:58:47

To you and everyone, a squeeze is when a stock encounters a spike in price forcing contract holders who had bet on a stock to drop, purchase the stock to offset losses thus further propelling the value of the stock. 

After I finish this paragraph you will shut the fuck up I hope.

At the time in which AMC was about to release the finger off the slingshot shooting it to $49 dollars and beyond, trading platforms shut down services and stopped the ability to purchase.

At this point it created massive panic and people sold, alternatively the heavy short positions (78% was shorted at this point) held settling the put, shorted positions, until a few days ago when the stock went up 120%. They waited till the stock was 5.37 to settle A Lot.

gr6v426;Scooter_McCabe;0;"Okay so everyone knows AMC has debt.  Also people talk about streaming like it's the theater-killer.

So AMC is reopening in a lot of places.  There are a lot of movies coming out and even after the pandemic still heading to theaters.  So ticket sales, concession sales and no actual plan to cease releasing major motion pictures in theaters.

AMC will pay off it's debts.  It will show growth and the share price will be cheap because all the analysts basically marked it for death.

But let's look at the studio system, streaming and a post covid world.

Movies like Endgame and Avatar were stupidly expensive but they pulled in wads of cash.  A release of Avatar in China recently put back on top as the highest grossing movie of all time.  Here is what studios like about theaters:

**Your profits aren't capped by contractual agreements.**  You rely on ticket sales.  The more tickets sold, the more your studio makes.  Every person that goes into that theater is paying for a ticket.

This is how they get paid just releasing to a streaming service like Netflix:

&gt; The **studios get** paid a licensing fee from **Netflix to** license a particular movie (or a group of movies), **to** be streamed an unlimited amount of times for a specified period of time (like for a year, or 18 months, etc,). This is why some movies and shows **are** getting pulled from **Netflix** each month. 

So they have to negotiate how much Netflix wants to pay to run their movie.  Netflix will never match box office returns.  Also there is no way for Netflix to control how many people are seeing the content streamed.  There is no one from the streaming service making a family of 4, their friends and extended family pay for each person that sits down to watch.  Netflix is working on limiting who can share accounts, but still nothing stops someone from having a movie night.  Those extra people that aren't paying for what they are seeing is a real profit loss.

Studios can pretty much know what movies are going to be worth while for sequels from box office returns.  People like the movie, they talk about it, other people see it and they do it in a short enough time frame to meaningfully track.  Streaming removes the sense of immediacy to watch the movie.  It's on your streaming service, watch it any time.

Next two are short and sweet.  Streaming services are actually crap outside of their few flagship programs.  They don't generate new content fast enough.  They can only pay so much for movies, so those movies have to be cheap to make and there are plenty of made for streaming movies.  Only 3 movies have been released directly to streaming services and nothing else.  No one is risking their company by declaring streaming releases only.

Which is just as well because in the post covid world the last place anyone wants to be is home.  Everyone is bored, everyone wants to be out and about.  So yeah I'd pay up for a movie ticket because it's not just a movie ticket.  It's an excuse for a change of scenery.  A shared social experience, and a big screen experience.

Remember I'm retarded.";wallstreetbets;2021-03-17 01:25:49

gr6pkqu;Drew707;2;"I have been thinking a lot on what DFV and Ryan Cohen (BTW, who edited his Wiki?) have been suggesting.  I live in a place with seven GameStop locations serving a population of about 500K.  I am not convinced they need many smaller locations, but fewer larger destination stores.  Think IKEA (but clearly not with the square footage).  Part of how they can diversify is by starting an esports league where you compete at your local GameStop to qualify for larger regional events.  These locations would need LAN center-esque facilities.  In addition to the video game events, they can expand to tabletop gaming, and general nerd retail, with a bit of social gathering.  I have seen a number of comic book coffee/beer bars pop up around town.  I think there is enough overlap in those demographics to make this a thing.  This is what I have been thinking about.  


Now, with your idea of AMC somehow getting involved, AMC real estate is going to already have a lot of the provisions that could make a solid GameStop like ticket booths, underperforming square footage, and concessions.  And they also have massive screens, projectors, and seating that could hold audiences.  Maybe they don't merge locations like what Yum! Brands does with their restaurant holdings, but there has got to be a synergistic opportunity here.";wallstreetbets;2021-03-17 00:37:03

&amp;#x200B;

I have 100 shares of AMC @ 11.33 avg. I Sold to open a call for $11 back when it was at like $9. Which I realize is kinda dumb cause if it exercises I lose money on it, whereas if I did a $12 strike I would have made some profit either way.  

&amp;#x200B;

My question is at this point, I don't think it's going to drop below $11. Should I buy to close the contract so I keep my shares? I feel like I'd make more money if I just closed it now and resold another contract or wait for AMC to go up and sell my shares which would get me more profit in the long run.

AMC is not a regular stock, this is GME's little brother. This a fight against market manipulators who have been trying to run these companies out of business. Those who hold are going to profit.

It seems simple enough but I have to ask, how much micro-managing do you have to perform?  you buyand sell based on the afortmentioned indicators, do you watch for them or have some form of notification via trading view (which i will have to aquate myself with)

I trade/invest on Freetrade (free account) which is buy &amp; sell only, no SL or TP but the urge to constantly check the market is there so the fear I am missing out is always there since it's always in my face.

as mentioned I'm only investing ¬£90 which is desposible income, I would blow it on some random crap if i didn't invest it but my goal is to out perform the banks interest on my main saving pot.   I could add funds but I want to keep it at a level where I can reasonably make more than ¬£30 pa and don't mind too much if i loose it all.

Once I use my savings (house) then i may consider some more long term investments 5 year +.

I used Freetrade as it's free and i can purchase partial shares, working with small capital would limit me to pennystocks but i bought;

$CRSR

$AMC (meme i know but sitting at +35%)

¬£IUKP

$BA

$PLYA

$RKT

$HUYA

¬£AV

and for a while the majority were green but thats only 2 months.

certainly using additional tools such as tradingview rather than the colour of my investment gain/loss would most likely be a better indicator of what i should be doing.";stocks;2021-03-16 17:31:42

Does anyone agree or disagree to this? Eh, it's a damn shame really :

Disagree -- bearish sentiment has always plagued markets. Generally what actually precedes bearish moves are poor innovations relative to market gains -- think dot com bubble - none of those sites were innovative or at least the vast majority of them. 2008-2009 crash was (in highly summarized form) preceded by Mortgage Backed Securities and suddenly everyone was able to buy a 1/2 $M house.

Last year, EVs finally became funded and able to be taken seriously -- so seriously new regulations are out for the transition. Teleworking became available to MANY MANY more people. Telemedicine too. Wallets are going digital. Cable is a joke. Arts and artists are getting financial value for their work via new platforms that are also being taken seriously (Pinterest, Etsy). Freelance workers have several platforms to choose from (Fiverr / Upwork).

Finally, GME / AMC / BB saga was a pivotal David &amp; Goliath moment between retail investors vs. institutional investors. There's finally a new tool in town for the little guy. The big players have always used this along with sophisticated software etc.. but we're seeing how powerful shared information is -- and we're going to be a better world because of it.

I've been here since before this became a movement. I did my fair share of spamming hold, short ladder, rocket emoji etc. 

I still have my original position. Bought more on the way up lost my ass kept holding on the way down. Recently made it back up with the recent uptick. 

Been making more day trading a few shares than I have since the begining. 

I think that's the play, day trade the volatility with gme and amc. 

Im starting to feel more and more like that's all this has ever been. The squeeze probably won't get squoze. The guys making the money are day trading while telling everyone else to buy and hold. 

Love WSB, but I'm starting to have doubts about the methodology. I feel for my fellow autists who may be left holding more than bags.

gr4vqga;Throwawayappleapple;1;I'm having trouble understanding spreads and when to close out.  Yesterday, I bought a put debit spread on AMC, bought 13.5p 3/26 and sold 13p 3/26 for 0.34.  This was when AMC was around 14.  Today, we blasted below 13, so I would have assumed I would be able to realize max profit, and my spreads would be worth .5 each, for a profit of .5 - .34.  Today, the spreads are still only worth .34, even after the stock dropped a dollar.  What gives/will this spread ever reach the max value of the difference between the strikes?  Any help in explaining this would be appreciated, thanks!;investing;2021-03-16 16:03:52

gr4ux1g;thekhalasar;1;People alway make this argument about companies they don't want to invest in but yet somehow they don't say it for others that make less sense (i.e. GME or AMC which will apparently be worth 20K someday). In a way you are right, but that can be said about any and all companies. The price of a stock is usually determined by how the market prices it, but very often the market prices stocks incorrectly in both directions (too high and too low) which results in corrections. Additionally, the value of a company is not static. The can create and destroy value based on their actions.;wallstreetbets;2021-03-16 15:57:46

2- stimulus checks drop this week. Instant deposits will put significant upward pressure

3- Melvin capital bailout. If they thought GME was done, they would‚Äôve just diamond hands the position as it faded down.

If you do the math, it only takes 11.11% for a drop of 10% but for a 90% drop it takes 900% to return to your original position. 

The lesson is simple: set your trailing stop loss at -10% for all long positions. Then it only takes a 11.11% return to regain your position. Don‚Äôt bag hold as things fall out. If you really like the stock wait and buy back in after the dip.

Since we kept AMC from being a dead cat, we should spread the love. It's Kitten Season, a time when shelters and rescues get stuffed beyond capacity with kittens.

They need cash, Apes. Most of them also have Amazon wishlists. Keep saving gorillas, because that's awesome, but let's start making some kitten wishes come true, too. Google for a local rescue group or no-kill shelter in your city, and spread the love.

AMC APES DON'T BELIEVE IN DEAD CATS

https://www.tradingview.com/chart/?symbol=NYSE%3AGME

Open up trading view and play with the charts a bit.

Click on f(x) indicator and then enable some of the built in ones.

Best DD is the ones you do yourself and see with your own eyes. Use the DD to help guide you.

If you want to see the OBV (On-balance Volume) that some of DD here has been talking about you can compare GME OBV to another ticker like TSLA of AAPL.

You will see some something interesting.

Edit: Back on my computer now.

GME - On-balance Volume

https://www.tradingview.com/x/9yLEeJ3Y/

AMC - On-balance Volume

https://www.tradingview.com/x/3pHrcxuC/

APHA - On-balance Volume

https://www.tradingview.com/x/4WxQP15t/

RKT - On-balance Volume

https://www.tradingview.com/x/e4ImTO5F/

BB - On-balance Volume

https://www.tradingview.com/x/hJ7n0wHg/

TSLA - On-balance Volume

https://www.tradingview.com/x/B3sH3OEi/

Notice the difference?

Price dropping on GME doesn't flow volume flow.

$GME is an anomaly. Even compared to $RKT $AMC $ANAL

gr4hj04;gaboose;2;You know the first time folks go into an AMC and see that the people all around them are not wearing masks because they bought popcorn, those folks are going to think again about going back to the movies anytime soon.  People who lived through the depression developed permanent frugality habits, and the same will happen with COVID and masking -- at least until we're clearly past this thing.

HF trying to split the crowd between AMC and GME ?
Share your thought on the topic apes ,,,,,,,
my thought is AMC is easy to short bec a lot of free shares floating around on the other hand GME is a lot harder to short bec a lot of Fail to deliver shares out there

and from a investors perspective AMC is cheaper to buy but easier to short for the HD , so maybe they will do a bull trap for everyone is investing in AMC to move a lot of volume from GME and again i'm just a R ape and this just my opinion , not a financial advise

to the moon my fellow apes this the best ride i had in the market so far and im just going to keep hdol GME , AMC to the moon

please share your thoughts on this..";StockMarket;2021-03-16 13:49:47

So they borrowed over 30.000.000 shorts of AMC as well of BB they borrowed over 90.000.000 RKT shorts and this only yesterday. Borrowed shorts can be used for three days. HF wants all of you to feel secure to invest your money, your stimmy on an obviously winning horse and then they will drag the price down so badly that all of you will lose a third or even all of your money. This is why they don‚Äôt fight a rising stock. It‚Äôs like attracting bees with honey. Don‚Äôt fall for their tricks and tactics try to be pragmatic.

They did the same with GME but luckily less GME shorts were borrowed yesterday furthermore GME is on the SSR list today. So all you got to do is HODL and buy if you can afford (no advice-I just like the stock. üíéüöÄü¶ç";wallstreetbets;2021-03-16 13:23:33

You actually sound so fake it's unbelievable.

You do realise that people are waking up to the fact that AMC only had a *fraction* of the support that GME has and that's why you're all getting bullied and criticised constantly.

Instead of constantly spamming some dogshit about AMC ""mooning"" or how it can squeeze (when it literally can't) 

Or how we should fight one another or how it isn't the GME market...

MAYBE you shouldn't have spent 2 solid months constantly spamming bullshit about how tethered GME and AMC are, when they diverged weeks ago. When they have different situations entirely. When their price projections are completely different.

I'm not shitting on another other stock. You do whatever the fuck you like, it's your money. But the attack on wsb with pro-AMC rhetoric last week followed by Cramer telling people to buy GME and AMC when GME is red and AMC is green is just so absurdly blatant to me.

I still have so many critical questions about AMC that haven't been answered. FOR MONTHS.

Like, it literally wouldn't be surprising...

The wsb subreddit saw an explosion of AMC promotion last week, before stimmies. 

Mods have never had to delete so many low quality and low/poor/*wrong* information posts about AMC until last week, some x4 as many.

On stimmy Monday we see GME *tank* even though retail isn't selling. We see AMC *leap* even though the volume says it's institutional. 

And we see Cramer telling people to buy both.

What do you think people will do, when they see that? ""Hmm, cramer said to buy GME and AMC.... but GME is falling and AMC is up 20% holy shit I'm going to buy AMC"".

...

It is bizarrely convenient that Cramer tells people to buy GME and AMC when GME is seeing red and AMC is seeing 20% gains. But before, silence. We absolutely know cramer is a mouth piece.

It's also weird because the volume on AMC exploded out of nowhere... that is some retail, sure. But really is seeing institutional levels of action.

Retail was never behind AMC as much as GME, but everybody behind AMC has been desperately trying to point out how identical the graphs are, even for weeks after they diverged.

And how the HFs shorted both!!! When... the SI% as a ratio of the float was **way way way way** lower for AMC than GME.

gr407gf;admiral_asswank;1;"Incorrect.

AMC sustained its debt repayment obligations using share dilution, but did NOT clear its debts. It was more about preventing liquidation by a creditor who would assume business executive control, rather than ""bankruptcy""

AMC accrued some hefty debt in 2015, 2016 and 2017 by expanding the number of screens they have. That's awesome.

2018 and 19 where good years, great even.

The issue is the damage 2020 has caused is still unmeasured. They lost some $6bn in revenue. That is NOT a small amount.

They need the next few years to be smooth sailing and growth on growth to ... stay afloat. Or, they will dilute shares again.

The debt problem is real. It isn't FUD to point to the elephant in the room. It's your risk and if you don't do adequate DD on a stock, but buy it because some randomly generated 30 day old username account tells you that AMC is going to 1000 and that ""the cinema is a magical experience"" (an actual comment someone wrote) you're really daft.";wallstreetbets;2021-03-16 11:21:04

Why does every 'pro amc' comment not actually ever explain the fundamentals or technicals of the stock... but say canned lines like ""magic of the movies"" or list movies they're going to watch.

Thats why they diluted shares and took out a loan, both to about $950mm

But not to get back on their feet. To fulfil covenants with creditors and give them starting cash.

AMC is still financially in hot water. If any degree of deviation from a good year happens... they're really at risk.

With lockdowns do to the pandemic movie theater and any large gathering had to shut down which gave other companies like Disney and Netflix to profit. The movie industry was already struggling with rights and primere so it only makes sense that the hedge fund shorts movie theaters because of it. I'm sure they hold strong positions on Netflix and Disney hence the price so if AMC blows up those other stock I mentioned will go down. 

I don't have any proof just prior knowledge from current events and topics so take my opinion as a grain of salt

I would love to see AMC blow up but it's competing against companies like Cinmax Disney and finally Netflix. Not saying it's AMC holds no value but it's definitely a long term play

People think holding is the be all, end all. It isn't.

Sure, we get a discount when they short us, but the cheaper they can buy of our their short positions, the greater the chance we lose this play. 

AMC for one has proven a huge distraction from our long term viability. We needed that volume today and all eyes were elsewhere. To many, this GME 5hing is just a trend and trends die fast. If this thing isn't showing strength then where is the volume from the Everyman going to come from?

gr3e9lv;OneMouseGaming;1;"buying the dip to average down when affordable is definitely the way.   


I'm actually doing the opposite unfortunately with my GME. I bought in on the back side of the 2nd ""crash"" at a few times for an  average 75.55  for 9 shares. 

  
I've been buying fractionally when sensible and I'm sitting on 9.39 Shares now. in the process though my average has gone to 85.8546 a share ( a 6.01 change over .4 of a share worth of buys)   


  
Averaging down when you are strongly out of the money is in my opinion one of the most important aspects in the WSB ""strategy"" of buying dips , holding long, and locking in the lowest average possible.   


\_ So to summarize while it is usually optimal to try to get your average cost per share down, sometimes a rise in that number is inevitable if you got in early enough.   


GME and this short situation makes this one of those situations where every share and every bit of a fractional share are going to skyrocket, so in this case quantity at a reasonable risk and entry point is my priority.   


I'm adding a snip from my fidelity - there's AMC and AAL below that and 1 share of GME on Robin hood back when it was 80 bucks. The wife is handling robin hood ( i know i know), smaller stakes but she is doing a good job. That's why the fidelity account became or trading platform for main investments. Also have 500ish working in stash just as a long term holding.   


Thank you to everyone in the WSB community for your information, analysis and conversation. ( ill honestly sell 2 shares when the second fractal tops out around 1200 to recoup my investment ( actually covers across all my trading platforms) and the rest is straight to the moon. I hope to have fractional bought 2.0 full shares in the mean time so i don't have to touch my main shares.   


I am diamond hand to the moon, but i want the wife to have a confident feeling out of investing with proper Due Diligence, and seeing real returns.

gr3dl8e;Starfish_Hero;3;"To stall. 

At this point, enough people are going to hold that they are fucked anyway. All they can do is chip away at just how many people are holding to try and lessen the blow. The longer this drags on, the more people lose interest. People see RKT or AMC have a good day and sell GME because of FOMO. People start to think January was the squeeze we‚Äôve been waiting for the longer it doesn‚Äôt happen and cut their losses. People just get tired of seeing GME posts everyday or tired of the volatility and just want to move on. 

Again, enough of us will hold regardless that it will still moon. All this money they are burning to sow even a little discontent just goes to show how disastrous this will be for them if there is any sort of momentum going into the squeeze.";wallstreetbets;2021-03-16 05:15:17

gr333jj;TrickyCompetition876;1;"I'm no advisor and this isn't advice, but I have personal experience with both of these.

I have exited SNDL entirely after 2 visits to the well - once barely profitable and the other a loser.  SNDL is attractive due to its low share price, but much of the research you can find out there suggests its fundamentals are not great compared to other pot stocks.  This industry has promise but I'm (probably) not going back to SNDL as there are better pot plays from what I've heard/read.

AMC is intriguing - there is surely pent up demand to get back to the theaters, but on the other hand, there is a lot to be concerned with: delayed rent and debt payments owed,  likely operating screens at less than full capacity while consumers get comfortable with being normal again, and share dilution to raise capital.  I think they are going to face a lengthy battle to get back to where they were pre-pandemic (but they will).  Right now is probably not the best time to jump in though, as there was a massive run up in share price today.  A lot of folks in other threads and youtube channels are playing AMC for big gains due to short interest, so it's really volatile.  I bought high the first time AMC went bonkers so I sold out of the majority of my interest as high as I could today to take a small profit.  I'm still holding a few ""free"" shares with the hopes these crazy people are right about the squeeze, but I'm not holding my breath due to the fundamentals.  

TLDR: this are high risk plays with potentially high rewards, or losses.  Proceed carefully if you decide to pull the trigger.";investing;2021-03-16 03:17:47

The market broadly didn‚Äôt rise much in 2020 because there were big losers (travel, entertainment, energy) and big winners (tech).  2021 so far has been reversing that. The 2020 winners are pulling back while those who got hit the hardest are rising on reopening anticipation. 

I think this is a ‚Äúbuy the rumor, sell the news‚Äù situation. There are some really troubled companies that are roaring because of the reopening narrative. AMC, for example, was in trouble before the pandemic. Now they have even more debt and diluted the hell out of their shares but people are buying because there will be a big return to the movies.  They have said themselves that if attendance returns to 90% of pre-covid levels by July then that only means they‚Äôll stay solvent until March. Yikes!  Sea World is another that doesn‚Äôt make a damn bit of sense at an ATH. Why would they be better than ever???

In my humble opinion, There's 2 fucking stonks right now.
How can that be so confusing.

If average Joe missed Gme and doesn't have X $200+ buy in, he will gravitate to AMC because it's cheaper and when GME goes brr the fallout will be AMC most likely raising with it.

Apes know that, so hedges must know that also.

But first GME has to raise if you're an ape.

If AMC goes first while GME dips, there will be less financial support and I think this is why if I was shorting, I would make sure GME stays low while AMC has it's moment and starves out from lack of (GME tendies) financial support.

If people keep their money/Shares üíéüôå in gme and there's no tendies to cash in, that a lot of money not in AMC so that's good for hedges.

Now, if people take their money from gme at a loss and jump to AMC, they can tank AMC and they just wrecked both and made wsb lose a lot of money in the correct order.";wallstreetbets;2021-03-16 02:15:15

My point is there will never be a play like GME ever agian and the constant suggestion that AMC is similar is neglecting the reality GME is primed for a bull run based on their pivot to E-commerce alone with the squeeze being a big fat juicy cherry on top. AMC is literally just opening up to losing less money they haven't changed their business model at all the only real bull thesis for anything above $30 a share is hype and the possibility of a small squeeze doing something beacuse all shorts can easily cover in less than a day and AMC is fully ready to release more shares to cushion their bottom line after losing their ass during the pandemic.

gr2uret;markmug;1;"Great question. I use the TD Ameritrade mobile app almost exclusively. Let me walk you through the steps:

Click watchlist &gt; your security (AMC in my case) &gt; trade &gt; click the right arrow on limit to ‚Äútrailstop‚Äù &gt; choose the quantity (100% in my case) &gt; click +\- and choose 10% &gt; expand conditions &gt; set a cancel timeframe in the future (3 months) &gt; confirm

Once it‚Äôs done you should have a wait stop order that says sell 100% at -10% Mark. Plus, if you go to the graph screen of the security itself you‚Äôll see a purple line that shows your trailing stop.

My exit strategy is sell 50 shares at $800 to clear my investment and then  üíé ‚úã  through supernova 250 shares.  If it goes crazy to $10,000/share, I will sell 150 shares and keep the other 100 shares through the split which will DEFINITELY happen if it gets that high.....I am guessing 10-1 so that GME can raise money for the conversion and become the Amazon of tech and gaming.

gr2ph9b;RoninOni;1;"I bought into GME shortly before the RH freeze. I didn‚Äôt get the worst of it, but I did end up down something like 60-70%, idk, I stopped watching. Bought some more on the way back up to lower my average.

Still green after today‚Äôs shenanigans.

What I‚Äôm really saying is you should have doubled down on the dip. I bought in on AMC at 14.50 and lowered my average to 11.50 last week.

The real question you have to ask yourself now is: ‚Äúhow much can I afford to lose?‚Äù

You want to go for a ride? Cause there‚Äôs a good chance you can sell for a decent % profit. I can‚Äôt guarantee that, this is called betting for a reason.

Me, I‚Äôm holding long. If there‚Äôs a rocket, or even a rocket test to the stratosphere, I want to be on it.

I‚Äôm also holding a personal belief that stock is worth more, or rather WILL BE once restrictions lift, especially with the new deals they‚Äôve signed that helps make them more competitive to streaming (which people are totally over after lockup for over a year).

I believe the repressed socialization aspect of theater going is leading to a huge boom in the theater business, so to me it seems like it will have greater value in a few months regardless of other market movements going on right now";wallstreetbets;2021-03-16 01:15:34

I agree the dilution makes it a $2-3 stock.  I‚Äôd not be stunned if they diluted today at the plummet.   If news breaks like that it will kill it.

Inb4 I'm full of shit, just google AMC dilution and read the excellent articles that will do a better job than I will, but if you don't understand what dilution is then know this, AMC diluted itself by over 75% since covid started.  This is as if a 4x split happened, but no one got the extra shares, and charts do not adjust for it.  If you consider the precovid price to be say $8 in Nov 2019, adjusted for dilution that is $2 today.  To put it another way, when you adjust today's price to account for the dilution, $14 is $56 ($14 * 4) in 2019.  Are you comfortable buying AMC at $56?

gr2junh;ehennis;3;"One man's opinion: 

Pre covid they were crashing because they had fallen out of favor and had run up crazy amounts of debt. People thought they were going bankrupt. They used the ""share dilution"" to raise hundreds of millions of dollars (no interest since it isn't a loan) to ensure they don't go bankrupt. Now, with that out the window they can get to work finding new ways of getting money.

WW84 was a complete mess. That movie alone will ensure all major studios release their blockbusters through the normal channels.

People realized during covid how much they love going out and seeing movies. On demand and streaming is convient but not the same. This next year will be crazy with back to back to back monster releases.

When you are spending $15 dollars on a share of AMC now, you are technically spending $60 for a share that was $4 pre covid.

&amp;#x200B;

I believe GME is down today because we are getting extremely close to the squeeze. The biggest indicator being that AMC is up today and GME is down. Hedge funds have shorted both GME and AMC and their price has mirrored for the past 2 months. Why all of a sudden did they stop mirroring?

It's because hedge funds are at the point where they have to choose between which stock is more dangerous. GME is the only stock shorted over 100% in history, so obviously GME poses a greater threat. Hedge funds can no longer afford to attack both GME and AMC. Their entire focus is on GME now and this is likely the final battle.

gr21kf9;BackgroundSearch30;2;"There's likely a mechanical effect that's happening from a negative gamma squeeze - hedge funds bought shares to hedge against call positions and keep delta-gamma neutral. As soon as all those calls expired out of the money, they have no reason to keep the shares. 

Knowing this looks like they heavily bought into puts Friday and today before beginning to unload. That would explain the blocks of 2000ish shares going bye, and then retail panic sets in as they realize that Wednesday's recovery was a dead cat bounce. The mania popping, and more of them lost faith when the prophecies of 300/500/800 turned out to be fantasies again.  


The best part is is that last Friday was the second biggest day for calls out of the money - this Friday is going to be much much worse. Everything above 300 is way out of position now, and the theta decay after today's decline is going to wipe out the premiums by tomorrow's open. Bulls are going to be losing a few billion a day at this rate. Just on today's open, the 300c @ 19 Mar lost 50% of their value, and by end of day they were down in total 75% from Friday.

Combine that with much better options for return on investment today like AMC and you can see where the flows made sense. This is also directly in line with the January discussions that happened in WSB. Lot of people argued that splitting amongst the meme stocks hurt GME the first time around, and that the January buyers would have been better off focusing on one stock, then ploughing the profits into another one en masse.

gr21f1a;wdrappo;2;"I think AMC is worth a buy and not just for the meme. 

AMC may seem dead in the water but it's worth considering that they're a well managed company, and covid restrictions are lifting soon and with increasing vaccinations people are going to be returning to theaters. Plus movie production is picking back up so more releases within a year or so.

On top of that the best argument against them is the prevalence of streaming services which isn't without its merits, but I think AMC can overcome. They have AMC+ which isn't huge yet, but could become more popular with more original content. AMC already makes some good originals and they have the infrastructure to make more in the future. 

Beyond the potential of them improving their streaming services though I still have faith that theaters will do well post-covid. A movie theater is a unique experience that you just can't capture at home. Sure they aren't at peak success, but they are going to recover from where they are now. 

In short I'm holding my AMC in expectation that it will stabilize at a decent price in the near future.";investing;2021-03-15 21:05:35

AMC being $8, being pumped by WSB, and theatres re-opening is almost a guaranteed recipe for success. I don't think there was a chance for downward movement there. That's smart. 

Having a couple shares in GME just in case it moons and for some fun? Also somewhat smart, because the upside is pretty high and the barrier to entry is pretty low. Putting millions into it? Pure gambling.

Remember, most people getting stimmy Wed/Thurs. Friday is quadruple witching. 22nd new DTCC regs.

Remember, THERE IS NO DATE. THERE IS NO EXPECTATION. 

This is the easiest thing you've ever done, just HOLD. 

If you feel like or want to buy, do it end of day and perhaps later in the week if you just like the stock.

Late March and early April will be a good time to watch some tickers. 

Maybe an APE or two will vacation in May after vaccination. 

Maybe we will see a ton of movies at AMC in May also. That would be a good time to see a bunch of movies and if you like that company, you could maybe invest in that once you're done with GAMES.

The future is bright in Infinity. Quick stop at Alpha Centauri and then beyond!

No animals, apes or papers were harmed in this above. No advice was meant to be inferred or delivered, certain apes just like the stock.

GME filled their gap first when they had the much bigger runs. AMC options were playing out nicely to create potential small gamma squeezes. AMC also recently started doing a share count after the CEO hinted at synthetic shares on the earnings call. There are good catalysts for AMC. Covid recovery play, M&amp;A possibility, short squeeze, etc. The pump hasn't even started yet. We are still tracking like GME with slight divergences. There were days GME pulled waaaaay more than AMC. The shorts weren't mutually exclusive to GME. They were shorting dying businesses and AMC  was down there in the mud with GME.

But I still believe the two are related. Even if decoherent right now. It can just be coincidence that a huge short attack strikes GME the same time AMC has a week-long influx of pro-AMC propaganda and AMC moons on ""stimmy monday"".

That statement isn't untrue about the propaganda. Mods have had to remove like x5 more posts about AMC than usual, even though its price movement last week was pretty consistent to the weeks prior, with no major organisational announcements.

That isn't wsb mods suppressing the truth about AMC. It's the opposite. If you use unreddit you can see that people are denying the float dilution, saying it's going to be 1000 a share and so forth.

It's not my fault that I'm drawing conclusions from correlations...

But I think in this situation it isn't an unfounded belief.

I'm saying that the current growth is faster than expected and may pull back, dropping some unsuspecting people. Because it has been repeatedly shoved next to GME, for being ""like GME"" even though that is demonstrably false.";wallstreetbets;2021-03-15 18:07:50

gr1bcql;FlatRateForms;2;"Ill keep this simple. 

AMC was days away from BK because of COVID. Dozens of $500m blockbusters have been postponed because of it or released both on HBO and in limited theaters. People want some normalcy when it comes to life in general (stating the obvious) but they really want to be able to go out and enjoy themselves. Me included. 

Going to the movies is one of those things people miss more than anything. Look at NYC. They opened up theaters and were playing movies no one really wanted to see, but they were still ‚Äòbusy‚Äô. 

Imagine when theaters open back up and you can see James Bond, Top üî´, F&amp;F, Matrix‚Ä¶ etc‚Ä¶ revenues will go back up after the first few movies crush it. 

You guys are quoting dilution and referencing Wanda and Silver Lake selling like it‚Äôs a bad thing. Who cares. Who knows why a Chinese firm didnt want to maintain their stake. Silver Lake sold at $16, we aren‚Äôt even there yet. Interpret that how you want, someone will‚Ä¶

‚Ä¶point is, movies aren‚Äôt going anywhere unless we get locked down permanently. 

Alternatively. GameStop isn‚Äôt worth $260 a share as it sits right now, not remotely. Regardless Of how much we all made (or more than a few lost), GME isn‚Äôt remotely trading on anything technical and the fact some of you think it‚Äôll hit $5k just blows my mind.

Market cap is literally irrelevant to squeeze potential. If the market cap is $300,000 ... does that mean that it has near infinite squeezability?

No.

It is to do with available FLOAT.

AMC has a disgustingly huge float compared to GME. And it's going to increase by 500m more.";wallstreetbets;2021-03-15 17:31:40

gr173x9;UnseenSpectacle2;2;"The days of valuing assets solely based on fundamentals went out the window when the Fed and Congress started handing out money via helicopters last year. Stop that action and fundamentals might matter. All it takes to run the market is to be the 800lb gorilla in the room. Until WSB, the HFs and institutions had the gorilla position locked up.  
&amp;nbsp;  
Even at today's prices, all it takes is a little over 1,000,000 like-minded smooth-brains with ~$6k burning a hole in their pocket to buy the entire 450M shares in the company. (Let alone when this thing was $2 or $5 p/s). If they truly are diamond hands then the fundamentals will no longer matter. With enough of them piling in with the hope of buying a solid gold PS5 for their wife's boyfriend, they set the price because a lot of HFs/institutions borrowed and sold something that they can no longer buy back to return. In this instance, the weakest smooth brain (including the AMC corporate smooth-brains) controls the share price, not the fundamentals.  
&amp;nbsp;  
Will there be a cliff? Yeah, there always is one. Where is the cliff? I don't know but certainly don't think it is here. AMC shares are still cheap enough to be a lottery ticket that doesn't expire.

There are more shares to wiggle out of their AMC shorts, their really deep hole is GME. 

Do what you think is best, (not financial advice) but I would avoid moving anything... GME being the shorting target still for HFs is a beacon we shouldn't ignore. It's the place to be when moon is in sights...  There is a reason HFs are expending so many resources in suppressing GME end of last week and today.

I was going to cut my losses and just accept defeat but once I looked into what the company is actually doing I decided to just stick it out long term.

3. Pre-pandemic it was trading at $20-ish per share. I figure as long as it returns to something near that level, and I bought at less than half that price, chances of making a profit in a year or two are decent.

This is what I consider collusion to create bag holders of the less financially literate, but tbf the financial reporting can only come from company issued filings.

You‚Äôre right, meme stock values can defy conventional pricing estimates, but in the case of TSLA the extra capital generated helped them grow even faster rather than just pay debts. In the case of GME there was a legitimate squeeze happening as shorts had to cover. With AMC issuing shares there are more shares available to cover so the short interest as a percentage decreases drastically.

REGARDING AMC

AMC is a dying company, and they fucking know it... They're taking a bath on covid and know people are not going to the movies anymore. They may be trying to drive up the cost of their stock so they can dump and get out with something.

AMC OWNED BY CHINA

In May 2012, AMC Theatres was acquired by Chinese conglomerate Wanda Group, headquartered in Dalian, who paid $2.6 billion to acquire AMC's 5,048 screens in 347 theaters in the U.S. and Canada. The deal was finalized on September 4, 2012.The acquisition made Wanda the world's largest cinema chain. Wang Jianlin, CEO of Dalian Wanda Group, announced that the company would plan to spend $500 million renovating AMC locations. But   then covid hit, and now no one goes to the fucking movies anymore, so there's goes that fucking plan...

https:\*//\*en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMC\_Theatres

PROCEED WITH CAUTION. AMC could very well be a pump and dump with a dual purpose of distracting us from the real prize, Gee Emm mfking EEEE... Once the wedgiefunds and WandaGroup saw what WSB was doing to GameStop, they decided to get shitposting and convince APES to buy AMC to spread us thin before they dump it... No one goes to the fucking movies anymore, why in the fuck should there stock be going up? I haven't been to a movie in over what, 15 years?

exercise caution with AMC and KILL MELVIN shortsellers!

Example I bought AMC for $7.  19.5 CC weekly we‚Äôre going for .15-.16 sense/share/$15-$16 a contract.  I sold 6 contracts for like $120 because it was a win if my amc shares got exercised since $19.5 is ~250%, while still giving me the option to write more this week.  Since AmC didn‚Äôt hit I‚Äôll took my money and will now rewrite the CCs to expire this week.

With CCs you are selling the upside/potential l of your stock/investments for a premium, so if it goes up you wouldn‚Äôt make as much money.  Aka of GME hit 800.  I would have lost the gains from 610 to 800.  If it stays or goes down, you would make more money than regular.

GME needs holders to restrict the float. Diverting capital away from GME or out of GME means that it takes longer for it to launch.

AMC is absolutely a distraction right now. There was a huge runup of pro-AMC propaganda on wsb the entire week... with absolutely no basis behind it.

REGARDING AMC

\&gt;Watch out for AMC. They're taking a bath on covid and people not going to the movies. I'm only talking about theaters‚Ä¶if they have other assets then they might be OK‚Ä¶however they might be trying to drive up the cost of their stock so they can dump and get out with something.

AMC OWNED BY CHINA

In May 2012, AMC Theatres was acquired by Chinese conglomerate Wanda Group, headquartered in Dalian, who paid $2.6 billion to acquire AMC's 5,048 screens in 347 theaters in the U.S. and Canada. The deal was finalized on September 4, 2012.The acquisition made Wanda the world's largest cinema chain. Wang Jianlin, CEO of Dalian Wanda Group, announced that the company would plan to spend $500 million renovating AMC locations

https:\*//\*en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMC\_Theatres

then go easy there‚Äîcould be pump and drump trick‚Ä¶once they saw what /pol/ was doing to GameStop‚Ä¶.they decided to get shills posting and get them to buy AMC too‚Ä¶.before they dump it. No one goes to the movies anymore. I haven't been to a movie sonce‚Ä¶.holy‚Ä¶15 years?

exercise caution with AMC and KILL MELVIN shortsellers.

Chinks bugpost on /pol/ all the time. They ran the wuflu op..

**On June 3, 2020, AMC announced it had ""substantial doubt"" that it would remain in business after closing its theaters due to the pandemic**

Yeah, I;m feeling that AMC shit is a bugman post pumping to trick /pol/ into raising their price before they dump it‚Ä¶also if they want to sell raising the price will make it MOAR attractive to any possible buyers.

To all the fomo'ers out there, relax.  Grab a share or a partial share, lots of room for these rockets to grow.  If you don't feel you can afford GME now, grab some AMC.  They are going to the same planet. 

For everyone else.  Buy a share and then make a t-shirt to wear around.  Apes that see you in your üíéüôåüöÄ t-shirt will give you a grunt of acceptance.  

You don't need 1000 shares to get involved.  You can join the üöÄ party with just 1 share or even a tiny bit of a share.

Not financial advice... Unless you plan to sell üíéüôåüöÄ t-shirts.  That's a great idea.  Do that too, then IPO that üöÄ and I'll invest in you!

gr0md1k;sub-jackofalltrades;1;"No, AMC is not GME, but that doesn't mean AMC's share price doesn't have room to grow.

The share dilution was a month ago. Doesn't that indicate the impact on share price has already been absorbed?

GME, TSLA, etc. have shown that fundamentals matter less than investor sentiment, at least in the meme stocks. With stimulus checks coming it's likely we'll see a lot of money flowing into meme stocks. I'd expect more money going into AMC simply because of the low cost/high upside. let's be real here, GME is not worth $300 let alone $100k but here we are and it's not all about the squeeze.

Didn't we learn last month that short interest is hard to pin down? According to Fintel-- **GME Short Volume Ratio 21%/AMC Short Volume Ratio 18%.** Why do you say there's no squeeze potential? Seriously, what am I missing.

gr0ln8c;HTXRed;4;"Call out anyone trying to push AMC and GME together, or people pushing AMC in GME threads. AMC is a joke, it would be impossible to squeeze and HFs would love to see you try. 

AMC is already diluted to shit and the financials show theyve been bleeding money for YEARS before covid. CEO gave himself millions in bonus recently despite the fact the company just delayed bankruptcy by taking on massive debt (just add that to the pile of debt i guess). They have announced they are going to dilute the shares even more, another cash grab that will likely end up in executives pockets at the expense of shareholders.

The biggest argument I see for AMC is ""pEoPlE wIlL wAnT tO gO tO tHe MoViEs AfTeR cOvId"" (I'm not even going to get into the short squeeze argument, people thinking AMC can squeeze were dropped on their head as a baby). Mofos were not going to the movies before covid even! From a speculative standpoint AMC could have pre 2016 levels of theatre attendance and still not claw themselves out of the hole theyve dug. By handing out CEO bonuses and diluting shares EVEN FURTHER they have also shown that they do not give two flying fucks about shareholders or the business surviving. Fundamental analysis of financial statements shows AMC is a dumpster fire that you shouldn't touch with a 10 foot pole.

TLDR: DO NOT FALL FOR AMC. GME is the only play right now. HFs would love for you to buy AMC. AMC is not the next GME, and it never will be.

ALSO: DFV is not invested in AMC! HMMMMMMM. Call out fucking shill posts of people linking DFV to AMC, DFV doesn't want anything to do with AMC. Stop trying to con people into AMC by using DFV image or likeness. There is no diamond handing and sticking it to the shorts by holding AMC, you look stupid claiming to be like DFV and then buying/pushing AMC.

And before I get a bunch of shill ass comments about ""why cant we just get along?"", ""amc and gme together ape, lets fight these shorts"" etc. STFU, stop trying to link a turd stock to the golden goose because you want it pumped.";wallstreetbets;2021-03-15 14:41:08

gr0l0hh;drestonxyz;1;"I'll give you 2 reasons: 

First, the pandemic has demonstrated that streaming is not a viable alternative to a social night out that includes going to the movies, so people will still want to go to the movies in the foreseeable future. AMC shares were suffering a lot pre-pademic because everyone one was believing the narrative that streaming would have killed theaters. Now we have empirical evidence that people want a night out.

Second, streaming does not even come close to revenues potential for movie producers, so the industry as a whole has a strong interest in keeping the theaters business very much alive.";wallstreetbets;2021-03-15 14:35:53

This isn't how forums are supposed to work. You told the guy he doesn't belong here because he's not an AMC cheerleader, as if you're some kind of authority on WSB culture, and when asked for more information on the matter, you can't even be bothered to offer your opinion, a summary of someone else's opinion or link an article/post someone else wrote for the explicit purpose of informing the reader.


Honestly, real question; please answer. Why are you even here if this is how you plan to talk to people? Reddit is a new age message board, the point is to talk to strangers about a topic via text over internet. If you don't want to exchange ideas/info than why bother commenting? You can just lurk.

The reality that many of these people live in is that the actual underlying value of a stock is completely irrelevant and not important. Because at the end of the day, stock prices are all fugazi. Companies are worth whatever we say they‚Äôre worth. A company could be losing $10B, and who TF cares? As long as they don‚Äôt close up shop and we can keep trading it ‚Äî that‚Äôs all we care about.

I think the thing they don‚Äôt understand is that there are NOT a finite amount of shares. Companies like AMC are adding shares and immediately dumping them to pay off creditors. If even 10% of people buying AMC realized that their $12 share today is at risk of being worth  $4 tomorrow ‚Äî not because we as consumers quit buying it, but because the amount of shares outstanding just magically increased 300%, the stock would tank immediately.

Maybe if we explained it in Charizards cards they‚Äôd finally get it. They‚Äôre worth (idk) 100k because there‚Äôs only 100 of them in existence? Well what if we suddenly found out that the makers of Pok√©mon just issued another 10,000 of them? Do you think those first 100 would be worth 100k anymore?";wallstreetbets;2021-03-15 14:26:56

gr0iph4;MrPasghetti;1;"I feel like the traditional valuation of a company is slowly shifting away from just it's Financials.

Call me an optimist but GME has shown that valuation of a company can come from different angles. I agree that AMC is not GME but I still see a small window of opportunity.

Let's put down the spreadsheets and just look around at the state of affairs. People, for the most part, have been held up in their homes for over a year now. We've gotten slowly accustomed to safer procedures when it comes to socializing (to some extent), and people generally miss 'the good old days'.

Lockdowns are being lifted, we've somewhat 'normalized' our pandemic situation, and people are anxious to go back out. Theaters are very accessible and they've already started announcing opening multiple locations. With so many great titles coming out this year, it is the first and most exciting form of entertainment that comes to mind.

Is that enough to moon the stock? No, I don't think so but I believe they'll see a surge in customers, which will boost their numbers and when compared to QoQ or even YoY it'll look (comparatively) like they are back in business. If they pass analyst's estimates it could attract some interest.

I have some doubts, yes. Namely the popularity of streaming services. But maybe that's a hidden gem too. With a year gone past of indoor binging, people want something new, something different, maybe something familiar. You can't fully replace the experience of going to the Theaters with friends/family and anxiously waiting for the movie to start. Put your phone on silent, the lights slowly dim, the movie is starting and people are whispering in excitement, the intro cut scene... it's started ""SHHHH!""

gr0hemm;brokemember;1;"No. Issuing more shares means decreasing value per share value.

Giving execs bonuses takes money out of company coffers. 

Not saying this applies to AMC...but go and read about companies that were about to go bankrupt. Pretty much every time they would give out payouts to their execs and leave everyone else holding the bag (once again not saying AMC is going bankrupt).

Bonuses to execs make sense when it is based on performance. Not when your share prices jump thanks to reddit or whatnot. Your execs did nothing to help the company. 

 &gt;but would that increase the unit price of the company by raising the employee value?


Bonuses to execs or employees don't raise company value. They are a good sign when a company has been doing well for a while and has increased revenue. Using stock dilution to do that just means you are screwing over your shareholders.";wallstreetbets;2021-03-15 14:04:47

gr0e82y;McDunkins;1;"I think we understand it well enough.  In fact, I agree with these kinds of moves and consider them to be a variation on üíéüôå.  But cutting your losses strictly because of FUD is not the same as selling (when you bought in high) to quadruple your position when there‚Äôs a fire sale.

I wish I‚Äôd sold when GME had spiked to 350 last week, cuz then I would‚Äôa dumped all of it back in when it dropped to the 100‚Äôs.  Can‚Äôt predict the future with absolute certainty - so the best course of action for newer investors (specifically for AMC, and GME with their insane volatility) would probably be to buy and hold.  

I‚Äôm not a financial advisor, far from it.  You really should make the best financial decision for you.  But if you‚Äôre buying into something because of FOMO and you‚Äôve done none of your own DD, and especially if you‚Äôre an amateur trader, you‚Äôd best be prepared to take a loss or double the fuck down.";wallstreetbets;2021-03-15 13:36:06

It's down heavily from it's highs and they are going to be announcing a merger date within the next couple of weeks, and the merger itself should by late april or early may. I'm anticipating some sort runup from the announcement and then the merger itself. The float on this stock is only 1 million shares, it's so tiny I think AMC is 135 million and is considered small for comparison. At it's price rn of $15 it's just insanely undervalued, I would like it less over $20 but it could run really easily.;wallstreetbets;2021-03-15 13:31:01

People thinking this is a ""rebirth"" play on GME and ""reopening"" or takeover play on AMC, and putting more faith in the latter.

People thinking retail has the power to control the fate of AMC through a maintained high share price. There was some talk of AMC having taken advantage of it to deal with debt, but I'm not so sure that was anything other than kicking the can down the road.

As far as my price, I think around here is a good price and think for a while it will be a good stock because none of the major studios liked what happened with WW84 with the VOD route. They want that massive number. The amount of movies coming out this year and next will be crazy.

After that, AMC will need to do ""something"" to keep the current price. If they try and go fancy with a dinner theather or possible work some deals with streaming services, I don't know.

gr07f1o;admiral_asswank;1;"THIS IS FALSE INFORMATION **AGAIN**.

GME AND AMC DO NOT HAVE THE SAME SHORT INTERESTS.

For your information, AMC does NOT have the same potential to moon like GME.

AMC had an agenda item to collapse all classes into a single stock class. Let. Me. Tell. You.

Executive time is most valuable TO THEM. They absolutely would NOT have an item like that if they don't intend to implement it. That float is extremely likely to increase by 500m shares, rendering ANY squeeze opportunity completely useless.

Why are you even bothering to talk about AMC having a higher price than GME pre pandemic? Do we go to IPOs and use that as a basis to determine what **tomorrow** will be? 

ABSOLUTELY NOT.

GME **is** transforming into an E-commerce company with an **extremely talented** team at the helm.

See how AMD transformed under new leadership? Yeah.

AMC is changing nothing. They are going back to business as usual. They already had substantial debts from 2016, 2017, 2018 from a rapid growth period ... which they begun to pay off in 2019 and unfortunately just got thrown 10 steps back by 2020.

One bad year isn't just ""one bad year"". It has seriously wounded their solvency. They **literally** had to acquire an additional billion dollars in debt to maintain their existing covenants, or their creditors would liquidate the company.

The fact nobody fucking understands how vulnerable AMC is, is astounding.";wallstreetbets;2021-03-15 12:25:59

Arguably, one might believe that if I have disposable income or my check already, EVEN IF I BELIEVE the stock is currently too high, I might be inclined to subscribe to the greater fool theory and buy NOW intending to get out when everyone else gets their checks.

For example, I bought AMC on the news it was restricted by RH and paper handed like a schmuck, believing that being able to buy when others couldn't was enough of an advantage to present an opportunity.

While I'm no expert, I might think that others might do the same thing, knowing there's pent up demand coming.

gqzttwn;863dj;1;"So I read the page on free riding on investopedia and how it relates to regulation T. 

Can you help me understand this a little better?

Let‚Äôs say I have $5,000 in my cash account. I purchase $4k worth shares of $DAL. This leaves me with an account balance still of $5000 with $1k of that in liquid cash reserves. 

Now I want to purchase 10x contracts of $AMC. 
10x $1 AMC 3/19 $20call (for a premium of $100 per contact for a grand total of $1k)

So my account balance is now $4k of DAL and $1k of AMC FDs. Assuming that these call options expire ITM on Friday I obviously cannot purchase 1,000 shares of AMC at $20/share. 

My question is will my broker allow me to hold on to the option(or even buy it in the first place) until expiration and allow me to sell that option even though from the start I never had the capital to ever exercise the option? 
Because I feel like I have a pretty strong grasp on the basic option legs and I want to try it out (definitely not trying to risk FDs out the gate, that was just an easy example)I‚Äôve got an account balance of ~$20k of different stocks that I‚Äôm not willing to sell yet, but have enough liquid cash to play with some options that I only intend to sell/ not exercise.";wallstreetbets;2021-03-15 08:59:02

In some cases like GME, AMC, the positions of retails are so one sided which force the wholesalers to take a very one sided position and disrupt their original business plan. Not just that also through counterfeit shares and other derviatives such as options, this one-sided situation is further magnified to such an extent which pushes the market maker into a corner position. This is not a good position for them as the size and direction is killing them slowly and will enter a point of no return. I buy and hold.;wallstreetbets;2021-03-15 06:19:04

gqzhxir;spairchange;1;"They're both total gambles.

GME is hugely overvalued and relying *entirely* on a enormous short squeeze that may or may not happen. If anyone tells you they know for certain, they're lying. If it doesn't happen, it'll crash back to 1/10 of its current price. It's a much more volatile stock. It could go to $400 on on Monday, it could go to $150. Total crap shoot. Long term GME will return to the dirt, the big question is the path it'll take to get there.

AMC is supposedly also on track for a short squeeze (that may or may not happen). The squeeze potential is high, but it's not the once-in-a-decade over-shorted mess that GME is. AMC is currently trading at a price which represents a much smaller departure from reality than GME. That said, it's still overvalued. Everyone keeps hyping it at every piece of vaccine or reopening news despite the fact it's already trading 25% higher than it was pre-covid.

I would say AMC has a higher chance of seeing *some* sort of upside, since there will probably be more news catalysts in the coming weeks that cause mini-pumps and ""movie theatre + reopen = good"" is at least, at a basic level, a good sign for the business.

gqyv721;Jim-Kool-Aid-Jones;1;"Great write up!  Definitely a solid basis for a pile of optimism.  Honestly I don't know how AMC could be positioned better.  My concern with AMC is their propensity to increase stock.  I get that they had to do something due to the pandemic, but I don't think they can really do that again any time soon.  Neither do I believe they will. 

GME is just insane no matter how one looks at it.  I am a full retard so this isn't advice but it appears to my novice eyes that GME has three way phenomena happening: Short Squeeze, Gamma Squeeze and the X variable of a massive retail following who is literally buying everything GME, no matter the price.  I don't see that changing especially considering the influx of stimmy payments hitting retail investors banks even now. 

I don't know about RKT.  I have some but I just don't have enough verified info to make an educated guess.  I believe OP is right though. 

BB is one of my favorites.  I have a mountain of BB stock and have had it for months.  I think the EV variable for them is going to shoot it into the stratosphere.  Maybe I am wrong but it sure smells and looks good.  

I am trying to edumicate myself about the ramifications of the 3/5/21 DTCC proposed rule.  Where are the wiggly angles for HFs etc to wriggle their way out of it.  There has to be a couple. At first glance it looks like a great change for our stonks but again, my novice brain just figured out what the hell a ""Put"" is last week....so F-Me if I have any confidence of my interpretation(s) of the ramifications for this rule.  TO THE INTERNETZ!! 

Thanks OP for the great write up.  I do like all of these stocks.  I especially like games and movies and I would love to grab an EV and know it has the latest greatest tech built in.  hehe

It is also possible that if GME takes off, the IV on them will go up as well, so it‚Äôs possible it‚Äôs profitable short term if that was to happen.

gqyr6mn;DutchTurk_;0;AMC was at higher price than GME thats true. Now GME is at higher price. That means company value of GME is growing when AMC is going down because of the pandemic. Amazons delivers growth has nothing to do with Gamestop. Every webshops delivery growth since pandemic. People can buy from Amazon i never bought from there in Netherland because everything what i can find there is avalaible in other shops with better service. And gamers can get the console from Gamestop in a half hour for the same quality and better service why should they order from Amazon. Amazon has a lot of products, but most of the gaming hardware is not for sale there. Its not focues on gamers. I dont see myself buying a console, gpu or gamers pc from Amazon. If it's defect i prefer to bring it to the shop and fix it without calls emails. Steam is owned by Valve and Valve makes also games. Other game companies will prefer Gamestop more than Valve owned Steam if GME can build a platform to stream and sell games.  Amazon sells everything but is not specialized.  It's chaotic like aliexpress. Gamestop will focus on gaming like chewy did. Long story short theaters will stay, but there best periods are in the past and there is no potential for further growth. Gaming industry and gamers will grow every year. Marches and profits are low in the theater industry. You know nothing about the marches and profits. You go to the cinema you think AMC is making money. Most of the time they lose money. People watch movie and AMC theater loses money. They have periods when it's full and run with 90% capacity thats when they make money. I prefer you to do a research and talk some theater managers. Because what i see is that you only focus on moon. Comparing stock price with a total different industry talking shit about GME and without numbers and future vision writing bullshit. If I ask you how many cash AMC burn you don't know.

Gamestop sells hardware, yes. However, with Amazon delivery growing more throughout the pandemic and growing much larger in the future, delivery is increasingly becoming more available for ALL products, especially gaming consoles.

AMC was at a higher price than Gamestop before the pandemic. Debate me on that if you'd like, but it's a fact. Yet you sit there and kick the worlds biggest theatre chain while it's down from a GLOBAL SHUTDOWN. Lol 

No, not everyone can buy a 165 inch tv. Are you out of your mind? You're grasping at straws now.

GME and AMC are shorted by the SAME hedges - it seems that you GME guys constantly shitting on AMC seem to forget that. AMC is incredibly shorted as is GME, the data going for AMC is as strong as GME. It's a multi-headed dragon and we're fighting different heads, they want people to only choose 1 now to minimize the damage to themselves. I view everything else outside of GME and AMC as a distraction since they have the strongest data going for them out of any other ""meme"" stock.

gqymwb2;teal_mc_argyle;1;"Hello sir and thank you for your work. I have a smoothbrain question that I cant find an answer to. Why aren't options trading level 1 and 2 switched? Why am I allowed to sell calls before I'm allowed to buy them?

For example I was looking at the AMC options chain. Let's say I'm cleared for options level 1. The second the market opens on Monday, I'm allowed to sink $1,161 into 100 shares of AMC, mash a button for instant $182.50 tendies selling a $10 CC, and lock myself into holding all those shares to the end of the week regardless of what happens, potentially risking my entire 1100 dollars if it tanks, on a contract I may not even understand and am obligated to perform. But I'm not allowed to spend $24.50 on an admittedly dumb as fuck bet that AMC will go to $20 by the end of the week, in a contract I may also not understand, but where I'm not obligated to do anything and the most I lose is the $24.50.

What the fuck?

I understand that most people aren't just going around buying a single call. However, on level 2 you're at least \*allowed\* to do that if you wanted to fuck around and find out, which I do. But on level 1, the \*minimum\* you have to invest to fuck around with is the price of 100 shares. I really do not get why.";wallstreetbets;2021-03-15 00:12:44

The facts are, AMC has huge debt.

AMC has a huge float which makes it cost prohibitive to facilitate any kind of squeeze... and doesn't have as much institutional investment as GME does... but is being touted as a GME-lite.

And another fact... if you bought AMC at the top and sold it at the bottom like a ""dumb paper hander""... to buy GME instead. You'd have already made all your money back AND profit on top.

Look at the cruise lines. They raised a bunch of capital in the debt markets, even selling unsecured. One unit of stock doesn‚Äôt give a company any money and if you‚Äôre at the point where your stock is going to put you under, then you were going under regardless imminently.

In fact, what comes to mind in terms of predatory action from companies, I think of Blue Apron and AMC selling at the market into their short squeezes effectively fucking anyone who bid them up. I also think of Hertz trying to get out of bankruptcy by raising new equity which was rejected by courts as it was entirely predatory.

Stocks price is nowhere on the income statement, balance sheet, or cash flow statement. It goes into enterprise value and market value of equity but that‚Äôs besides the point. The cash and operating resources are all based on the money raised at the time of sale.

Then he says it's all bots, social media is evil and used by terrorists to manipulate markets. Here are some direct quotes...

&gt; Many at Wall Street hedge funds were caught in short selling positions, having to cover the differences in prices between the low price they bet on in their ‚Äúput‚Äù options, and the actual price as their options were set to expire.

&gt; When the short sales options became due and the price did not match expectations, the hedge funds who expected to win lost big.

Or the equally important question‚Äîwho is a bot and part of a bot farm in an effort to manipulate results? Bot farms exist, and are sponsored not only by criminal enterprises but also by state-actors.

&gt; Bots and bot-based activity are a significant threat to not only the personal privacy and security of the average person, but also the valuation of well-known companies like GameStop, AMC, BlackBerry, etc. The public is engaged in a virtual congregation and exchange of information that could literally be anybody, from anywhere or any automated program.

gqy1di1;Gyper;2;"Alright so after I financially recover from my gme blunder at the end of this month , I want to try this for real now.

I will have a good chunk of money saved up in my nest egg (20k, would of hit this goal sooner,but setback) but I will always keep this 20k in liquid.  Any money I make above that and after my usual expenses are paid, I want to set them aside for investments.

I will be able to set aside 500 a month for a roth IRA.  Which leaves around 1-1.7k a month set aside for other investments. 


For someone thar is going to throw down about 1k a month in the market. What's the smartest way to go about this?   What are some literature I could read for beginners

UWMC is way less risky, and much more likely to rise from here. A forward P/E below 7 is dirt cheap. This has been beaten down because of the fear of rising rates affecting refinancing but I think that whole narrative is off base. They make more money on mortgage origination and we are seeing more people moving out of cities (ie going from renting to buying) with more work from home flexibility. 

I think this spring (very soon) we will see a lot more homes go up on the market and a boom in new mortgages. Rates are still very very low, and I doubt it‚Äôll have a significant impact on people moving.";wallstreetbets;2021-03-14 19:34:33

gqx47ha;EthanCoxMTL;2;"As an editor with a media outlet in Canada that has nothing to do with covering the stock market, these critiques are a bit off base. 

The issue of media slant is never so straightforward as ‚Äúsomeone is paying off the journalists.‚Äù There are two main contributing factors in media bias:

1. Self-censorship. Journalists and editors perceive the interests of their employers, and shy away, sometimes even subconsciously, from coverage critical of those interests. 

2. Social cohesion. This is the main thing. Journalists that cover WS are part of that social circle. Their friends and acquaintances work for hedge funds. And if they‚Äôre TV journalists, they‚Äôre paid enough to feel like they‚Äôre in the same class. So their sources are insiders on WS. They‚Äôre not necessarily trying to slant their coverage, but they are talking to hedge funds and learning from their perspective more than they talk to people here. 

None of this precludes the possibility that someone like Cramer did a consulting gig for Citadel, that would probably be against his network‚Äôs ethics policy, but given his stature he could probably get away with it. 

But generally, the reason why media aren‚Äôt covering something is because they lack capacity. Media has been gutted, and a lot of stuff goes uncovered as a result. I‚Äôd vaguely like to write/assign something about WSB, but it‚Äôs far behind a lot of other things on my priority list. Maybe I get to it, maybe I don‚Äôt. But if I had the budget an editor in my position would have had 20 years ago I‚Äôd be covering it closely. 

The real threat is that so much of what we read isn‚Äôt journalism, but sponsored content paid for by someone. And journalists not covering X is about capacity not bias in 99% of cases. 

Just wanted to throw in my two cents, because I see a lot of media criticism on here that seems to misunderstand the industry.

gqwus8b;ThiccFlairWooo;1;"This is broken down super well and is a beautiful reference for ""relatively"" normal behaving stocks.

1. Not a fan of applying classic technicals to extremely volatile stocks like GME 
2. GME is up 1,400% YTD. There are short positions on this stock across a wide spectrum, most of which are *well below* the current price and a significant portion at &lt;$75. Imagine the sheer amount of capital needed to maintain delta neutral on a position that has massive intraday price increases like that. How long will short sellers be able to keep throwing good money after bad? Some HF/shorts are def winning on this deal, no question. Some are also bleeding bad and wont's survive this. I can venture to say that most shorts fall into the latter category at this point. 
3. Pure speculation here, but the collective buying power of WSB apes (and others convicted to make the squeeze happen) would be one of the 20 largest HFs on Wall Street. A lot of this capital is heavily concentrated on a couple of stocks (GME, AMC, etc). As you can see from the sub posts, Apes are not using delta neutral strategies to trade. Or any strategy other than buy and hold. No puts. No selling. The beauty is in the simplicity. 
4. I believe the shorts are applying principles based on years and years of trading. The math checks out, the algos are solid, the technicals are a valuable guide. But this is no typical trade.

gqwr35j;thet-shirtguy;1;"It's really a simple answer. GME. Here's why.
AMC is a movie theater, and that is all it will ever be. There is no scaling, there is no growth. Their 52 week high is just over $20.
AMC may spike, but it will be short lived. It's simply got no where to go and is HIGHLY dependent on Hollywood making great movies. As we have all seen, most movies are rather average. 

GME on the other hand, has the ability to pivot and become an ecommerce player. They're making changes to bring it from brick and mortar to revenue streams ranging from a partnership with Tesla (gaming chair drivers seat to play while your car drives itself), online competitions that end up at sports venues for gamers to gather, and wager on outcomes (think Draft Kings), for those who can't attend in person, PPV for the tournaments.

Roll the dice with AMC if you like, but GME is a solid play even if it doesn't go moonshot. It will be a $600+ stock and grow from there. Look at the changes in corporate structure. And don't think for a minute that RC and company aren't pissed as hell at the bullshit the hedgies are pulling. I wouldn't put it past them to issue a 10-1 split with a $5 dividend.

I now see why GME is such a unquie squeeze, but I still see potential with AMC. I believe the May Fourth vote is simply to count shares and trigger a squeeze. If I am wrong, I am out a lot of of money, but so far I've almost doubled my money. Is this increase in AMC because of covid restrictions lifting? I don't think intially but I believe that is a factor now. I believe people have done their own DD and see potential as I do. I can't lie though, you are persuasive. 

 I think it's a safer play as Q2 report will probably show incredible gains making a $20 stock price achievable. Post Covid AMC is profitable. Look what happened when NYC opened. LA is opening theaters Monday. I think this natural increase in price will also trigger more people to think ""the rocket can take off"" and fomo sets in.

In conclusion, I see AMC as a legit long play with the potential of a squeeze. Hopefully their board members also see the potential as GMEs board has.

I might be stupid here, but there's a lot of parallels here. Rugpulling someone who poses a huge risk by sending them huge fees. The main difference is it seems whatever rules they used to rugpull Robinhood they were already assessing daily.

gqv97cb;Cstooby;1;"Not sure how long you've been investing but this strategy will get you bankrupt in a bear market. In 2008 if I never sold the stocks that were tanking and put them in better choices or even keeping it in cash, I would have lost most of it. Even though the market eventually recovered it took several years. In that time I was able to make back most my losses by switch stocks and strategies. 

What we have been experiencing over the past few years is one of the best bull market runs in history so I can understand that you think that stocks that are tanking will always go back up...but this not the case at all. In most cases if a stock tanks it usually doesn't recover for a very very long time or it goes bankrupt and your done.

Show me a person that's been investing longer than 6 months that has never picked a dud before and ill give them money to invest and so would everyone else in the world. No one, and I mean no one, picks a winner every time. Even the best investors in the world pick duds sometimes. The goal is to pick more winners than losers.

I just gave you an example where opportunity cost most definitely was applicable. I bought amc and gme at the same time. I got into amc when it was at 13 bucks. It tanked down to 6 bucks and sold it and put in gme directly. If I kept it in amc I would still be down today but now I've made the money back and much much much more. It is most definitely worth it whether your original investment is 100 bucks or 50k.

There are time where holding through a dip makes sense and there are times where it's the wrong choice. If a stock drops from 400 to 60 in a week, it can literally drop to $1 or even go bankrupt. Hindsight is 20/20 we know now that gme recovered relatively quick so it was the right choice to stay with it. But at the time there was guarantee this would be the case.";wallstreetbets;2021-03-14 04:01:38

gquwt0k;Shtonky;1;"$GNUS long. 

Hey Gorillas! I know we're still balls deep into GME and AMC right now, but, yo, $GNUS is poised to reap some massive tendies. Yes, it's a penny stock worth only $2.17 right now. But, considering a week ago it was around the $1.50 mark, you'd have very easily gotten 50% return on your money in a week.  Now, from a technical standpoint, it looks pretty damn bullish on the daily chart.  the 4EMA has crossed over the 8EMA with no other moving averages above it, and it's moving up along with the TTM\_Squeeze indicator, RSI, and ATR. If we get a close above $2.25 next week, we'll have jumped the Wyckoff creek and should continue up towards $3 and beyond.  The amount of good news surrounding this stonk is hard to understate.  100mil homes have the ability to stream their content, Arnold Schwarzenegger is staring in 'Stan Lees Kindergarten Hero's' launching on 4/24 and they're announcing something with Marvel on 3/30. Not only that, but the CEO announced a deal with Roblox 3 days ago. There's also a lot of unusual bullish option activity on this guy with $2 strikes expiring on 7/16/21. So, I think if you get in now, you're still very early to the party, and it'll be the cheapest and least stressful way you'll go to tendie town!

It‚Äôs a healthy stock that will get back to 20 at some point when the world opens back up again and people actually start going to theaters. I‚Äôd say do your DD and look into a promising SPAC. $40 will get you roughly 4 shares, and if the merger goes as planned, you can maybe watch your $10 share turn into $40-60 within a year. If it flops and the merger falls thru, you get your $10/share back. Ex: a spac that‚Äôs sitting at 10.21 is a pretty safe bet. If it fails, you‚Äôre only losing the 21 cents.

gqusqnv;_Duality_;1;"I mean, in my reply, I admitted it is a gamble‚Äîalbeit a calculated one.

But honestly, right now, reason why I'm still holding to see it through (and yes, this may seem self-fulfilling/circular) is GME just got a foothold with momentum ahead of those. Look at some other popular memestock like AMC (same ""squeeze"" potential and ""solid"" fundamentals), it's been floundering because it just didn't receive as much retail impetus and media attention. 

And I haven't read on SKT/RKT since I have no positions with them but at least for you to be aware, GME next week alone (at least with respect to the squeeze) has stuff like:

1) Stimulus speculators riding the hype or ""movement"";

2) Current calls for a shareholder recall to force shorts/MMs to sort out the shares;

3) Bonds issued by GME that are maturing on the 15th and being settled well unlike what shorts hoped;

4) Congress hearing on the 17th; and 

5) Stuff like the new DTCC disclosure rules, the conference call on the 23rd with ecommerce ""whizkid"" Ryan Cohen, quadruple witching hour on the 19th and ETF shenanigans holding GME.

I know it might all be a nothing sandwhich but I am definitely holding to see the fruition of this shitshow (which might be next week as stated or some longer timeframe). If it pops off given these catalysts, I'll cashout and maybe leave a few shares to ride the long term potential. If it doesn't pop off, I've already made six digits and still have that long term potential.
 
In short, I do not see SKT/RKT having these same contextual factors and catalysts available. There's still time to speculate.";stocks;2021-03-14 01:13:40

gqukgsh;Cstooby;1;"It does make sense. People sell for many different reasons some are rational some irrational. 

If someone thinks that the price is going to continue to go down they will sell. Many did just that even if they bought at 450.

The idea that it's not a loss unless you sell is incorrect. There is something called opportunity cost which is basically a person losing out on another investment that is currently increasing in value. 

Someone invested $50k at $100 a share and it dropped to $40 that would leave them $20k. If they sold the day it dropped and put it into another stock that was mooning the next day they would have recouped the losses and then reinvested it back into gme but with much more money. This is opportunity cost, missing out on a potentially mooning stock by keeping it in a losing unrealized loss position. 

I bought in gme at 70$ and averaged up to $115 before it tanked to 40$ I made a calculated guess that it will go back up faster than another investment that was available so I held and am still holding.

On the other hand I lost on AMC and I sold it when it tanked and put it into GME. That was a wise decision even though I was down in amc... gme has risen much faster than amc and by a significantly larger amount. If I didn't sell it and left it in amc I would have lost that unrealized gain that I just made.

So yes it makes sense to sell if someone thinks that the price is going to continue to go down or if they have another investment that will rise faster.";wallstreetbets;2021-03-13 23:53:22

gqubwlz;theboxer16;1;"Quick question, would love some insight:

I have 1 $1.86 AMC $5c 4/16 that‚Äôs ITM current stock price is $11.34

Right now it‚Äôs worth $6.35 or $636 if I were to hypothetically sell it right now (it‚Äôs Saturday market is closed I know). Therefore $636 minus my $186 premium I paid would be a net profit of $450 if I sold right now (robinhood says I‚Äôm only up $449, but close enough). 

If I exercised right now I would pay $500 plus the $186 premium I already paid so $686 then I would 100 shares valued at $11.34 which would be $1,134. If I then immediately sold it now it would be a net profit of $448 or about the exact same if I just sold the contract instead of exercising. 

If I sold now I could make a &gt;200% profit, but let‚Äôs say I think AMC is going to moon to $20 eventually and think it could happen before expiration. I would probably want to wait until it launches off closer to expiration then do this math all over again and see if selling the contract or exercising it would be more lucrative, right?

1) If it's an old company it turns a profit or at least has for a sustained period.
2) It could have been getting shorted from that time, but if I'm not mistaken it was comfortably above $10 for a decent while and then the price started to drop, nothing else massvely changed to warrant that imo. 
3) It certainly shouldn't drop the price.
4) It could have been shorted since then, and because it's profitable it didn't go under...tbf it's a mystery to me because nothing major happened that year to warrant the drop. Tin hat for me there I guess.
5) It gets enough shine to do well recently which is nice and I earned a little profit already which I'm too stupid to cash in on.
6) Cinema + Girlfriend was the crux of my point there. Historically good things happen there.
7) We're now 1-1 for tin hat theories! But seriously, the entry rate is low and affordable for those who don't have the initial funds to drop into GME and Two meme stonks isn't too much imo.
First I seen of GME it was a sign that made the front page of Reddit saying GME/AMC GO BRRR. And it caught my attention..Do if it was a diversion it worked to opposite for me because I now have shares in both.
8) We're good.
9) I personally consider cinemas to be a relavtively safe bet but personall preference there.
10) I agree, You could be right about PLTR, I like RKT myself too because they are a genuinely successful company also.

2. No it has not, at the very least not on paper, 5 weeks total of 1 year has it been a ""10$ stock"" AMC has also been falling and failing since 2016. 
3. That might be true but what you need to take into consideration is the immensley huge volume AMC has - that short interest can be covered in a single day without even raising the avg. volume. 
4. It is a reasonable assumtion to assume AMC fell due to covid and I agree when we see Hollywood release all their movies as Covid is gone we should see a bump  in AMC. But I woul also like to point out AMC has been on a downward trajectory since 2016 - was covid a kick in the face: sure as fuck but AMC was still laying on the ground already.

gqu6d8v;getsuum;1;None of it means anything at all to me. There is no way I can guess when people are going to buy in and rocket the price. No chart no graph no good news. Stocks drop on good news. I buy in after looking at the daily, reading a bit about the company past and present, look one more time at the daily, then buy if its low with good news coming. Hold for a day, week, sometimes a couple hours, or couple weeks. I do pretty darn well. Always have about 15-20 open positions, average down here and there with gains from others, pick up more small positions on new ones using same method. Fuck all the analysis,  if the chart has a double bottom, triple top, head and shoulders, balls and weiner.....whatever dude, still doesn't mean you can predict the human element of them actually buying or selling. That said, GO AMC! sitting on 750 shares at 5.15. I bought this a while back because of the fact when people come out of their caves from quarantine,  thus is a 15-20 $ stock anyway. If it pops with WSB action, even better, but not counting on it. GME, won't touch it with a 10 ft. Pole. The human element is fucking that stock up so much, you can't possibly apply any normal DD to it, or a graph. Lol. Anyway, don't be a follower, diversify, small positions, multiple positions, NO FOMO- missed money is better than lost money,don't get greedy. I'm always down in some, green in others, cashing out on one or two a day, buying back in so.ewhere else, or avg down a good one. Keep it moving, if your good enough to just pay attention, you can't lose. I might make $500 today, maybe $50, maybe nothing for a couple days, holding red. But I never lose.

I  find it hard a business that was on the brink of bankruptcy and had to be shorted to survive, would dilute their positions. I have a MBA in business, however, I am realitively new to stocks. I might not be seeing things from the prespective needed, as my focal point is business.

gqu2xi2;ccheuer1;1;The issue is the float on AMC keeps changing because they keep flipping new stock into the marketspace through various methods. Every time it gets close to squeezing, they release more. Note, this is not an effort to protect hedges on their part. They are trying to keep their business up and reduce the debt burden on the company, so are flipping a lot of their obligations over to stock and w/n. I'm not saying that this alone is going to tank any hopes of substantial profits from AMC (I alone saw 30% gains from riding AMC's cyclic nature), but it is something that you must keep in mind and weigh before making any decision to invest.

1) It's an old and profitable/prestigious company.

2) It's been more than a $10 stock for a long time.

3) By nearly all accounts It's been shorted by around 19% as we speak.

4) The stock fell due to covid and because it was most likely being shorted a whole lot more than 19% which is a reasonable assumption.

5) People genuinely like the AMC brand...Crazy right?!

6) Between the age of 15 to 20ish it was my go to location for a high potential hand shandy run, longer movie increased that probability also. Nostalgia points.

7) It""s an official meme stonk, In my opinion the second most popular, but that's up for debate.

8) Like minded retail investors collectively investing in a stock is a relatively new thing and for the low low price of $10 a share you get to pull up your popcorn (gotta be AMC, It's the nicest);and see how this whole thing plays out.

9) I personally consider it a safe bet a $ 10 a share, but we'll see.

10) Finally, if GME goes crazy I predict that  people will want a second hit (after they have saved every gorilla ofc and spent money on some of the most outlandishly wholesome shit imaginable) and people will flood into AMC like something the floods into or onto something at an incredible rate.

gqty6p1;Scooter_McCabe;1;"Okay so AMC and GME seemed to be linked in price movements.  AMC is the poor man's GME right now.

I'm running through my head how to work that.  Start in GME ride profits, dump into AMC call options.  Start with AMC calls counting on the price movements mirroring each other.  Profit and then come over the top at GME counting on two weeks for everyone to get their stimmy checks and jump on the Ape powered rocket ship.

There are benefits and draw backs to both.  GME options are ludicrous expensive because everyone knows the volatility could cost them their ass.  GME stonk is also pricey if you are just using your Stimmy check to fund a play.  So max 5 to 6 shares and then you have to sit.  Up shot is mass Ape migration into the valley of GME means no matter how high the bananas you have help to reach it.

Meanwhile AMC is cheap but the redheaded step child of WSB right now.  So you can buy reasonable calls, decent amount of shares.  But you are praying the linked movement continues and 20 dollars seems to be the highwater mark which is 9 bucks from its after hour pricing.  GME highwater market was 450ish or so.  Not as much interest. BUT AMC is a great long term play because of its bat out of hell escape from failure and all the reopenings.

Now if a bunch of Apes dive on AMC profit and run at GME things will get bonkers fast.  I imagine the lack of an initial rush on GME would inspire short selling and hedgies to swing hard but then get caught as the Ape wave shows up eventually.

If you are counting on the GME rush happening out the gate then making fast money and long terming AMC would make for an awesome play. if you are suddenly doubling your money and dumping it into cheap shares likely to be over 20 by 2023.

**GET READY TO FUCKING GO!**

Money from the government is poised to rain down as soon as this weekend for most Americans. And while many cash-strapped families will use funds from the $1.9 trillion pandemic-relief bill to cover rent or past-due accounts, another cohort may use the $1,400 payments to ignite the stock market‚Äôs next retail frenzy.

‚ÄúI probably will take about half of it to invest into stocks,‚Äù said Iyana Halley, a 28-year-old actor who recently appeared in NBC‚Äôs television drama ‚ÄúThis Is Us.‚Äù The Los Angeles resident remains on the fence about which equities to buy, but has been keeping a close watch on social media and seeking guidance from a friend she trusts.

‚ÄúI want to see what will make the most sense, where I can get the most out of my money,‚Äù Halley said in an interview. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm still new to the stock-market world, so trying to figure stuff out.‚Äù

The retail buying may come as soon as Monday, giving the Nasdaq 100 Index new wind after it fell into a correction earlier this month amid a crash for some of the market‚Äôs most speculative names. The checks ‚Äúcould offer a short-term ‚Äòshot in the arm‚Äô to a market that was otherwise looking run-down and vulnerable to a sell-off,‚Äù said Sam Stovall, the chief investment strategist at CFRA Research.

The tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 has stumbled since a February record

Individuals age 25 to 34 with online brokerage accounts plan to use about 50% of their stimulus to buy stocks, according to a survey this month by Deutsche Bank. Americans who earn as much as $75,000, or couples making $150,000, plus their children or adult dependents, qualify for the full $1,400 per person. Two parents with a dependent child would get a combined $4,200 injection.

‚ÄúStimulus checks will almost certainly drive more retail buying,‚Äù said Eric Liu, co-founder of Vanda Research, a firm that tracks retail flows in the U.S. ‚ÄúThe social media attention has remained strong.‚Äù

Tyler Hopkins, a 26-year-old computer technician for a school district an hour east of Los Angeles, spent about half of his two previous pandemic stimulus payments on stocks including GameStop Corp. and non-fungible tokens. He plans to buy more shares of retail favorites when the latest payment hits his bank account

Stimulus Investing

U.S. investors plan to put a significant chunk of any forthcoming stimulus into the stock market

‚ÄúI‚Äôve been buying **cbadword** and stocks for a while now, but the stimmys helped pay some bills and I put the rest of them into investing,‚Äù Hopkins said.

For all the excitement that the stimulus payments are stirring up among younger traders looking to make a killing, investment professionals have been wringing their hands. They worry that unsophisticated newbies buying stocks they heard about from memes or online forums like WallStreetBets could take already stretched valuations even higher.

‚ÄúYou could say it‚Äôs like gasoline on a fire,‚Äù said Kimberly Woody, a senior portfolio manager at GLOBALT Investments. It‚Äôs ‚Äúparticipation from a lot of folks that really just don‚Äôt know what they‚Äôre doing.‚Äù

The retail mania has been raging for almost a year now. The gamification of investing and consumers seeking entertainment during pandemic lockdowns led to massive surges in stocks generally shunned by the long-term investor community, from companies like Gamestop, AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc. and headphone maker Koss Corp. Those bets helped spark massive rallies that featured dizzying bouts of volatility.

Halley, the Los Angeles actor, is aware of just how dicey it is taking a flyer on the fringes of the stock market, so she‚Äôs hedging her bets. She plans to spend the other half of her stimulus on acting classes.

‚ÄúI think with stocks or any kind of investment, it‚Äôs always going to be a risk,‚Äù she said.";wallstreetbets;2021-03-13 19:17:20

Just want to say that this is the way it‚Äôs been since January (RKT was added more recently, AMC was removed) and this is not a progressive way of preventing the market makers, banks, and hedge funds from making the trades, it is actually a way of limiting TD‚Äôs risk by offering less options to retail investors.

If I want to sell a cash secured put on GME or RKT, which are LONG positions, by the way, (bears r fuk, they pay ME the premium) I have to call, sit on the phone for an hour, and speak to a representative of the trade desk to open those positions. It‚Äôs because they‚Äôre ‚Äúhard to borrow‚Äù securities, and they want to mitigate risk.

This is nothing new, nor does it have ANY indication over what is going to happen with the stock. It is simply TD Ameritrade mitigating their risk. I love TD, and I‚Äôm not leaving the platform, but it‚Äôs important to not conflate a rule that is taking away ability from the retail investor with a rule that is intended to limit hedge funds‚Äô ability to make trades that I can guarantee you they are absolutely still able to make.";wallstreetbets;2021-03-13 18:02:42

Patterns that replicate due to the core rules of the algorithms themselves.  So generally I agree and I wouldn't base all of my DD on TA.  But, it does (I believe) give us a glimpse into computer ""thinking"" with regard to market trends.  So it can be worth considering when looking at the big picture.

Why do you rip on them for never saying something with conviction, you can't say the market can't be predicted, and rip them for not having full conviction something will happen. That's just contradicting your own argument.

As someone who watches Trey a lot to get updates on AMC and such, I can say that while, like all info, it's not 100% or even 70%, it does help people understand better what to look for.

Personally I've become much better at predicting when to buy in or sell, and that has due to understanding patterns etc.

At the end of the day, every bit of info can help you make better choices. All those small advantages can help you trade better.

You decide what info is helpful to you, I don't really care too much about chart info either in these videos, I mean I understand much better what happens, but when I want to make a move I check the charts right there and then.

My wife and I live in the US, are 36 years of age, have one child with a combined gross income of $220,000.  We both max out our 401K to the IRS maximum, have three months savings in a high yield savings account and just recently paid off all our debt except for our home which is at 2.875%.  After overhead and saving for our son's college fund, we have a few grand left over every month.  

We recently opened up a brokerage account which we put these surplus funds into so it does something other than looking for fun things that we don't need.  If we decide to travel or need to make a ""major"" purchase our plan is not to dip into these funds but rather not contribute for X months.  

Depending on how things go, we may use these funds to purchase a second home (rental) however if the market tanks, we just won't do that.  As such, we believe our risk tolerance is pretty high.

Right now our portfolio consists primarily of VOO (80%) with a little of QQQ (6%), DIS (6%) and ARKK (2%).  The last 6% are what we consider our fun picks (AMC, CNBS, RBLX).

Our plan is to keep this strategy, depositing surplus every month, into our brokerage account with 80% of it being VOO or QQQ and the last 20% between DIS (my wife's pick), ARKK or other stocks/ETFs that we might think are worth putting money in.

As someone that has been doing this for approximately 9 months, I am looking for any feedback that you may have.

That is why I think the chinese company Wanda dumped earlier this week. 

I don't see any billion dollar company adding 500,000 sharers and dilutioning themselves when they just had the gift of being overvalued and essentially ""pumped."" This is their ticket to a fresh start plus post Covid sales. I could be wrong and they could dilute their shares, but I HIGHly doubt it.

gqt704l;ZZ556;1;Well it's kind of nice that China no longer controls the voting shares of AMC.  So now it's just class A shareholders that control the vote.  So based on my half assed reading of an article a few days ago, you could in theory buy half of all the shares of the company and then you'd could control a company losing billions a year with a questionable business model post Covid.    But hey that could make up for the four or five times dilution of AMC stock over the past year, someone could want to own a theater chain.  Market cap is relatively small, I know there are antitrust laws not allowing it but what if a studio bought them out.  Maybe a streaming company, maybe a social media company wants new offices.    Again I'm just thinking out loud, I'm just wondering why shares are above two dollars.  I no longer think that shares will fall to the five or six dollar level anytime soon.

AMC is more of a ride up, let slide down, ride back up stock because throughout all of this, the AMC board has been putting more and more stock onto the market (for example, their response to the Jan. Spike was to allow a shit ton of shares to convert so they could be traded, wiping out hundreds of million of debt for the company). 

AMC is making smart plays around this to support AMC. Awesome, great. However, those plays are also massively increasing the risk for people that are buying in while the momentum is going.

Just a personal tip in case you are not already doing this, but i will look at OPs post history and then of course read the comments sections to see if their DD gets picked apart by reddit. And for that, i really love reddit compared to just investing in a stock based on something i heard on tv which has nobody critiquing it. The comments sections tend to be a good way to decide if a DD is worth following or not (although not in gamestops case. Everyone picked apart DFV for an entire year on his DD)
So since early November almost all the stocks i put on my watchlist because of DD i saw on reddit either took off or had small gains. The steel stocks are just starting to take off right now, they were like the only ones still in the red up until like a week ago.

Streaming taking at least some percentage of viewers away from them. Might only be 5-10%, but that is enough to cause serious problems with their low margin business. 

AMC is probably not going to be acquired by Amazon (or any other large tech corp lol), i mean why would they. Amazon is in streaming. 

Theaters are opening up, but limited capacity in 1/2 of states, and Europe is a shitshow with vaccinations and AMC has a large number of theaters in EU.

It may have some extra cash in order to stave off bankruptcy this year, but that doesn‚Äôt mean the shorters have any reason to not keep holding their short positions. Their thesis is movie theaters are slowly becoming unfavorable and outdated as streaming has quickly taken over. and amc has not been rumored to, or announced any type of metamorphosis of the company in order to change the mind of the people shorting the stonk. 

Whereas GameStop has announced a complete reincarnation of itself into an e-commerce gaming company. So this gives reason for shorters to close short positions as the price goes up because the short position thesis that: ‚Äú gme is a failing brick and mortar mall gaming store‚Äù, has fundamentally changed. This means there is more uncertainty in holding their short position so they will be more willing to accept defeat and exit their positions.

gqrk867;Doug_E_Lewis;1;Well... AMC has about 4.8 times the amount of shares as GMC.

I'm all over the place. Day trade, swing trade, stop.loss, limits, fundamentals,  meme's.
AMC drove me crazy
.got out early with two small wins and avoided GME only b.c I felt like I was late but it rallied and rocketed. I just did not trust it this past week, and, I so so regret not buying it. 

I have 2500 wanting to break through the red with random stocks and I am going to hold.
The other 2k is down by 4% but I'm feeling good about them. 

I think I'll stick to news, some hype, swing and short term for mid gains. My personality thinks he's a day trader but won't execute when needed so, I watch the missed opportunity right in front me...
so, probably not the best fit..not until a huge win then I'll be right on top.of it!

gqrayjs;Scooter_McCabe;1;"I'm looking at a bunch of possibilities and it's maddening.

AMC:  Did good for me today.  Analysts are against it, but NYC just reopened.  LA is reopening.  Sort of the redheaded step child right now with GME being the golden child.  Dare I buy calls in the face of possibly trading flat at 11 all next week?

GME:  Great news over the past weeks.  Great management coming in.  Surged like a son of a bitch back from 40.  Stimulus checks coming out and Hedge funds haven't figured out to leave this one alone.  But it's expensive.  I mean I don't have the cash for options.  It would eat up most of my stimmy check buying a few shares, but it's another Ape in the take over of the planet.

Ford:  Bullish good news with the EV.  Chipped into Tesla.  Rinky dink recall of 2.9 million cars for air bag inflator.  It's right there at it's 52 week high.  So does the mo carry this sucker over 14 bucks.  Or does the ""bad news"" and being near its high make it a juicy target and puts are the play?

BB:  So the EV news with Ford was cool.  BB worked with Ford and Jag for a time so there is a relationship there.  Ford owned Jag for a minute back in the day.  So why is that important?  Well Tesla is probably doing their stuff all in house, Ford will probably reach out to BB again.  Ford has been chipping away at Tesla too in the EV market.  So Ford and BB rise and fall together?

TESLA:  692 feels cheap to me.  I never got into the whole Elon thing.  But I listened to a few interviews and appearances on Joe Rogan.  He's an impressive idea machine that can sell the idea.  So yeah I can see it rising again over the next few months.  Also that spin off is going to be ridiculous.";wallstreetbets;2021-03-13 02:04:03

This person imo probably can't afford to YOLO money into a meme stock. A lot of the folks over there are under some delusion that they're sticking it to HFs while HFs are the ones truly making a killing off the GME play. I turned a pretty good profit trading on the AMC and GME frenzies but I played with money I could afford to lose and got out with over 100% gains on each, hell nearly 400% on AMC I was pennies away from the recent $20 spike.

Why is BB rising again?


So BB rose this year because of not only good news, including a partnership with Amazon and patents, but also it was somewhat mixed in the Meme stock craze but not as much as GME or AMC. So when that bubble burst, BB corrected itself back to what it was before the Meme craze, right? So this week the second round of Meme rises happened, but BB was only seeing a few percent gains, compared to GME which rose dozens of percent. Now today we see BB up 13% while GME is up 2%. Even though I've been trading for 4 years, im still a noob and am just hoping someone can explain this new rise. Also, im guessing its going to fall back off in a few days and this is obviously temporary. Thanks for your time.";stocks;2021-03-12 21:54:27

gqqbwfa;ionized_fallout;-2;"03:47 PM EST, 03/12/2021 (MT Newswires) -- AMC Entertainment Holdings(AMC) was the most active among the most cited stocks on Reddit's wallstreetbets on Friday, with shares jumping 9% in afternoon trading on slightly lower volume.

The movie theater company, which has been under considerable financial pressure during the pandemic, released better-than-expected quarterly earnings on Wednesday. AMC also revealed it has now reopened 527 of its 589 US theaters.

Shares of GameStop(GME) , which has served as the center of the wallstreetbest universe for the last several weeks, were up 6% in late day trading on slightly lower volume.

Palantir (PLTR) , which has also been in play for some time on the subreddit, was trading largely flat. Volume was down from 86 million shares on Thursday to 50 million on Friday.

Forum regular Tesla (TSLA) saw its shares slip 2%, while BlackBerry (BB) shares climbed 9%.

Cannabis producer Aphria(APHA) was also back on Reddit radar screens Friday, with shares gaining 3%. Also attracting attention was Chinese EV maker Nio (NIO), with shares dipping 2%.

Elsewhere in the broader market, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 1% and the Nasdaq Composite Index eased 0.6%, while the S&amp;P 500 hugged the flatline.

I had no idea the company was having financial straits before COVID and I was a frequent visitor to my local AMC. I'm pretty sure that a good chunk of the population didn't know either until WSB brought attention to it. WSB saved AMC just as it did with GME. Now that it's back under the spotlight, it's evident that AMC is taking advantage of the situation so they explore other options and prevent themselves from falling into that hole again.

I KNOW my friends and I aren't the only ones that are desperate to get out of the house to go on dates again.

""The January 2021 conversion by holders of all $600 million of the Company‚Äôs 2.95% Convertible Senior Secured Notes due 2026 into shares of our Class A common stock at a conversion price of $13.51 which resulted in the issuance of 44,422,860 shares of our Class A Common Stock and reduced annual cash interest expense by $17.7 million"" 

The key word is Conversion, they didn't dilute they simply converted from inter company investment into common stock... 

Dilution happens when you create new stocks out of thin air...

Think of it like two glasses of whole milk, Glass A is common stock and Glass B is AMC'S Ownership portion... both cups have the same milk in them... when the conversion happened AMC took Cup B and poured a little into Cup A, there's still the same amount of Milk in the combined glasses. What this means is AMC takes a little less profit when they make money. Now the creation of new stocks, which might happen on May 4th is like taking Both cup A &amp; B and adding water to it... yeah the cups are fuller but there's still the same amount of milk in the glasses but the milk is thinned out by the addition of something new aka water aka new stocks...";wallstreetbets;2021-03-12 18:43:05

Nokia (My biggest Value Play)

I am not so sure on the Nokia 5 calls...as this is not really shorted... But then again, Nok had a high today 4.21 and sitting at 4.17 today (In line with Nokia.HE as it closed at $3.50 Euros).  William Barr (AG) wrote a fantastic speech on China 5G Domination vs. Rest of World and specifically state we should invest heavily in Nokia and Ericcson. (This was also last year, but momentum has already shifted).

RKT

Completely agree with you on Rocket.. Highly manipulated stock since inception.  I agree that this has wings.  The buy back is key I think to remove the shorts and sky rocket.  Fantastic earnings for 2020 and 2021 outlook.

AMC 

Also agree - I am in some mid leap calls.  Whether meme or not, this company has value.  I am with you on, wanting to get the heck out of my house to watch a movie at a theatre.  

&amp;#x200B;

The March 19th date (calls right before that) are a bit risky for me.  I would assume the HF/MM are already doing strategies to protect themselves... Then again, I am hoping for all of these to grow substantially!

If the 1 GME and 29 AMC I have would turn to a few hundreds of profit, that would be great. Though I bet the negative side of me would still insist on thinking rather of ""what could've been"" if I had been watching all this AND had money to actually INVEST something.

gqpjpty;ExtremeNihilism;1;"It's not whether you bought stock or not that's the point.  I believe that's the source of your confusion.  It's that it doesn't matter what people said at $30, this is a long-term play and, again, if that bothers you emotionally, as it clearly does, then perhaps you should stick to AMC and GME.  You're literally complaining about what people said while reddit pumped a stock up during one week.

I'm happy to talk about this more with you.  I'm happy to educate younger investors that have a lot to learn, as you do.  This sub is more geared towards people that hold long term.

I am one of the newbs that got into investing through meme stocks (AMC in particular). Fortunately, I didn't bet more than I could stand to lose. The thoughtful posts in this sub helped me learn about investing and helped me develop a sound strategy that works for me. After cutting my losses, diversifying, and reinvesting in safer options, I have finally recovered my losses from my meme-era introduction to investing and feel confident in the long-term health of my portfolio.

gqpgl34;quaeratioest;2;I wouldn't be happy with the risk/reward there unless you really want to own AMC stock. I like to sell credit spreads with at least 10% in return over the collateral.

I still think it's going to go around $30, but not in an instant, and I really doubt it'll happen before the whole GME story arc is completed.

gqpbcl0;harrison_wintergreen;1;"partly, you just bought at the peak and things have cooled off. 

partly, you bought trendy/meme stocks like BB and AMC. don't chase trends. when everyone is buying X, you should be suspicious and looking for Y and Z. 

ditto your core position needs to be something covering a broad cross section of the US market. S&amp;P 500 index, Russell 1000 index, a total market index. this will be a lot safer. IMO people should't start with single stock until they have at least a few thousand in a broad market index. 

&gt;Watching YouTube sometimes

the majority of YouTubers are worthless on stocks and investing. absolute trash. IMO the only things worthwhile on YouTube are interviews with Buffet/Munger, Peter Lynch, Joel Tillinghast, Howard  Marks, Joel Greenblatt, etc. professional investors with decades of experience. 

go to your local library. read books on investing. I recommend the following: 

Benjamin Graham, The Intelligent Investor. Dated in parts, but the ""Mr Market"" chapter and ""margin of safety"" concepts are worth 10x their weight in gold.

Snowball: Warren Buffett and the Business of Life

Peter Lynch, One Up on Wall Street, and Beating the Street. In that order. Also a bit dated in some ways, but the basic advice and methods he teachers are bulletproof. 

Joel Greenblatt, The Little Book that Beats the Market

Christopher Browne, The Little Book of Value Investing.

Common Stocks and Uncommon Profits, by Phillip Fisher

His son Ken Fisher has written some good stuff, 100 Minds who Made the Market is a good historical overview of the history of Wall Street investing. The Little Book of Market Myths is free on his website: https://www.kenfisher.com/books/little-book-market-myths

gqp8vxa;subsetsum;1;"Let's clarify a bit. 

If you buy a call option and it expires out of the money (for example you paid 3,500 for 10 GME call options expiring today with a strike of 500 like I did), you'll only lose the 3,500 at most.Options have two components: intrinsic, which is how much the stock is above the strike, (or below, on the case of puts), and time value, which increases the further away you are from the expiry date. This is called theta. In my case there's very little theta left though, with such high volatility, there's still a chance I can get out.

Now, if you sell a call option on a stock you already own, like I did with AMC, this is called a covered call. You can theoretically lose more than you want, but here you have set a sell price that you are comfortable with. I got a $1,300 premium for selling calls with a strike of $8 expiring next week. By doing this, I was hoping that the stock wouldn't close above 8, so I could keep the premium, and the stocks, of which I have 2,000 shares at an average price of 8.65 (bought in at 16 and dollar cost averaged down.) The premium I received by selling the call lowered my average cost to $8/share so I break even.

So how do I lose money? When AMC hit $13 not too long ago, I had to watch helplessly contemplating the thought that the $10,000 gain ((13-8)*2000) wasn't mine, but the option buyers. I now have a trade in to reverse this if AMC climbs high enough. 

I hope my detailed walk through of these trades helps. 

You can lose infinite amounts of you sell a stock or call option short and then the stock rises. That's why we are seeing such volatility now.";wallstreetbets;2021-03-12 15:54:56

gqp87v8;Snoo_86776;1;"Looks like last year, before all the other stock runs. Cramer on cnbc was going balistic over bbrw making a 4000% run in may. And the chart looks tge same so far this year. A feb spike, then a march drop. Most predictions are pointing towards an april bump (volume and news) so it is a good set up for a repeat of the may run. Now normally people wouldn't give that much credit, however with the AMC / GME repeat, and our new stock market red flags of inflation predicting a market crash on FAANG this could very well be a radar event for hedging losses for big players.

gqp7m9l;MentalContribution9;1;"I am quoting AMC 10k from today: 

Other Creditor Discussions. While the liquidity we have raised has substantially extended our liquidity runway, the new debt we have issued, together with the higher interest rate payments that will be required in the future but have largely been deferred, will substantially increase our leverage and future cash requirements. These future cash requirements, like our deferred rent obligations, will present a challenge to our long-term viability if our operating income does not return to pre-COVID-19 pandemic levels. Even then, we believe we will need to engage in discussions with our creditors to substantially reduce our leverage. We expect to continue to explore alternatives that include new-money financing, potentially in connection with converting debt to equity, which would help manage our leverage but would be dilutive to holders of our common stock. We expect we will continue to receive from and discuss proposals with all classes of creditors. These discussions may not result in any agreement on commercially acceptable terms.";wallstreetbets;2021-03-12 15:45:27

gqovnv0;BisexualFag69;1;"Honestly I'm not sure but I think it totally depends.... 

The creation of new shares doesn't mean that all the new shares will be made available to the public... a company might do this if they are looking to take on a huge investor to allow the new investor to take a large share of the company without the Orginal company losing controlling amounts of shares. I've heard a lot of people saying with Amazon making more movies and running many ads in AMC theaters that Amazon is potentially interested in becoming a large investor in AMC. Which makes sense to me...  If this is the case we should expect the price to stay the same or maybe even increase in my opinion... 


It also just raises the cap on shares, so them doubling the number of shares doesn't mean that their will be double the amount of shares on the market, they can hold them as long as they want...


Also keep in mind we are pretty sure AMC is on our side, if you watched the interview with the CEO of AMC the way he spoke of us redditors and the meme stock was with love, he said he was shocked by the outpouring of support for the theater industry... I don't think he would want to turn around and fuck us all out of our money... so it's totally possible that this whole shareholder vote is a ruse, that they don't actually plan on doubling the number of shares but by forcing a shareholder vote they force all the shorts to be bought back before the vote... they could be initiating the squeeze for us in the only way they legally can...


Also keep in mind it's a shareholder vote, so the vote could come out as a No, and then there won't be the creation of an additional stocks...

gqoo26a;tetsmon;1;"short Buffett advice 1: don't waste time looking for the next amazon or tesla, tesla and amazon succeeding as we speak. 

short Buffett advice 2: stick to the boring things, if it's steadily making growing more than 9% a year, that's good enough


long advice:

i'll start off by saying you've started learning at the weirdest time (it's not your fault), and practically anything that's happened in the last 12 months is not normal and shouldn't be used as a reference. I've made incredible returns by investing during the pandemic dip, but I know it wasn't because i'm the next Buffett 

I started off sort of like you, albeit with much smaller sums of money. research is important, but I believe expereince and ""getting used to"" the whole stock market thing is possibly even more important. I'm talking 2-3 years at least. 

it's fun to find advice on potential big growth investments, read up on it, and buy it. I still do it too. but what I've learned from my experience is ""do I really, truely understand and believe this company is going to grow?"" 
I can't do any of the fancy analysis MBA guys do, so I try to stay away from unfamiliar fields and stick to familiar names. if i do invest in unfamiliar territories, it's really small amounts (like 1% of my portfolio) just to help me keep an eye on it. 
Most of my portfolio is ""mainstream stocks"" with that I understand has potential for steady growth, like Disney and Google. I also have Crocs stock, which I will admit I have no idea why it keeps on growing, but it must have a very solid business model. 


as for your current portfolio, ask yourself if you really understand the inner workings of those industries.  don't just trust what others say, can you visualize for yourself how it'll grow in the future? personally, I don't have a clue about gold or AMC or that chinese pharma, and can't imagine how it'll do in the coming years.

if you have a hobby or interest, try looking at related companies (for me it's cars and tech). a lot easier to understand the industry when you enjoy the things";stocks;2021-03-12 12:55:29

So I, for one, am being super cautious. But I digress. 

Beyond the arguments people have made that AMC had been performing poorly prior to the lockdowns, there is also the change that the pandemic has brought to streaming services and how they operate. It boils down to this: would you rather pay $50 bucks for movie tickets for you, your wife, and kids, plus another $50 for a water bottle and popcorn - cuz let‚Äôs face it, that‚Äôs where theaters make the most money. Or would you rather pay $20 to sit on your couch at home and watch that same movie with all of your own shit?

'We should see the GME short squeeze continuing': S3 Partners

GameStop (GME) has already had quite the week, up almost 80% since Monday following news that board member and investor Ryan Cohen would play a key role in the business‚Äôs e-commerce strategy.
Bulls expect the presence of Cohen, who founded pet goods retailer Chewy, to help the company fulfill the potential GameStop fans believe it has as it transforms from a brick-and-mortar focused business to something more modern.
The GameStop bulls who see the company as an underrated, long-term value play may not be paying that much attention to the moves of the stock, but it‚Äôs hard to miss the roller-coaster ride. As the stock spiked on Wednesday, short interest continued to fall, perhaps after short-sellers learned their lesson in the late January squeeze, losing billions.
But according to Ihor Dusaniwsky of analytics firm S3 Partners, the short squeeze will continue.
‚ÄúWe should see the GME short squeeze continuing and more short covering in the stock as mark-to-market losses mount,‚Äù he told Yahoo Finance late Wednesday. ‚ÄúBut as the stock continues its rapid climb, there will be short sellers waiting in the wings looking for entry points if this rally loses steam and GME‚Äôs stock price retraces.‚Äù
Short interest may have fallen, but it‚Äôs still significant: $2.76 billion with 11.18 million shares shorted, 20.52% short interest percent of float or 17.02%, depending on how you calculate it, according to Dusaniwsky. (S3 prefers the latter, as it doesn‚Äôt count the synthetic longs created from a short sale. If this is confusing, S3 has a good explainer here.)
To put this into context, fellow meme stock AMC Entertainment has a short interest percentage of float of 17.32%. Tesla, another famously shorted company, is at 5.98%, and Amazon at 1.03%.
‚ÄúThis has not been a profitable trading week for GME short sellers, after being down -$1.36 billion on Monday and Tuesday,‚Äù Dusaniwsky said. ‚Äú[Wednesday‚Äôs] +7% price move added another -$202 million in additional mark-to-market losses.‚Äù
All in, GameStop shorts have now lost $6.8 billion year-to-date, Dusaniwsky said.";wallstreetbets;2021-03-12 12:33:52

gqoaii2;hybridck;1;"&gt;Dude you're part of the GME bagholders club sub, I saw numerous comments regarding GME but yes most others aren't GME related... but enough them are negative for me to stand by my remark or perhaps you unknowingly helped in that regard by adding numbers / legitimacy to a trash sub spreading FUD. 

I'm actually not FWIW. I have visited it before to see what it was about after someone linked it and iirc I did comment there once (maybe twice as part of the same thread) about dollar cost averaging IIRC. But I'm sure if you scan my profile with one of those third party extensions used by mods you'll find that's literally the full extent of my participation on that sub. But yes when I have commented on GME since the first peak, it tends to be negative. 


I used to work in finance (not at Morgan  Stanley but a similar buldge bracket bank, although I suspect revealing that is going to make you think I'm a shill even more now). I was on multiple teams, the first of which was in middle office Clearing (although OTC Credit and Rates not Equities) so I kinda had an understanding of how the plumbing works behind the scenes for trades. The bulk of my GME related comments, while negative, centered on trying to explain how the system worked with things like T+2, the DTCC, collateral calls, Robinhood getting caught with their pants down, etc. Maybe that could be considered that to be FUD but imo that's just trying to explain the financial supply chain.


By the time I left banking I was working front office OTC Credit and Rates, which if you look at this Anastasia lady's LinkedIn, you'll notice is what she does as well. That's why I said I was less convinced she had anything to do with AMC after looking at her profile. At least when I had basically  that same job, granted at a different bank, we had nothing to do with retail equities. These teams are heavily siloed and don't really overlap across different products. I personally don't see why it would be different at Morgan Stanley. 


As for OP, the way I see it is there's two possible reasons they could be receiving an email from her. The first is he works on her team, in which case, I doubt he's involved in a conspiracy with Morgan Stanley for the same reasons I don't think Anastasia is. That also explains why he has a Bloomberg. He's using his work computer (which I imagine is going to get him fired when compliance finds this post). 

The second possibility is he works for one of her clients and that's a marketing email (she is in sales after all, half her job is spamming clients with those emails). I guess that could look worse if he works for a hedgefund, and I don't have first hand experience for how siloed it is on the buy side (the institutional investors side of the industry). From what I've heard online and irl is that it's pretty similar though. Teams that trade interest rate swaps and credit default swaps (his team considering he's receiving an email from her) are different from teams that would be involved with buying/shorting stocks. In this case still, thats why he has Bloomberg access and I imagine their compliance is also going to fire him when they see this post. 


As far as whether the post itself is misleading, idk it seemed well sourced and thought out to me. Everything was linked to either an SEC filing or a screenshot from Bloomberg.

gqo8kvd;Fly__Eagles__Fly;1;"Buying options that don't expire for 60+ days is a lot more expensive, but for good reason.  They actually have value and smaller fluctuations in stock price make them move more as a result.  

Wheeling between covered calls and cash secured puts is considered much less risky.  If you sell options when the market is climbing you tend to do pretty well.  On Wednesday I did a buy/write: bought 100 AMC @ $11.50 and in the same order sold a covered call for $14 expiring 4/16 for $2.50 premium per share.  Cost basis goes from 11.50 to 9.  I can buy the option back (\~$100 today) or I let it expire.  At expiration if AMC is under $14 I keep the $250 and my shares.  If it is over $14 my shares get called and I keep the $250 + and get $14/share for the 100 AMC and walk away $500 richer.  The risks are that you limit your upside (AMC is $100/ea I still get $14/ea) and the stock tanking.  However if the stock tanks you're better off having the premium and shares than shares alone. r/thetagang has good advice and explains things pretty well.  

Just started this strategy this month and since 3/1 I'm up 34%.  Can't wait to see how I fuck this up.  I'll make sure to share.  If you're interested SNDL is cheap af.  100 shares for $140 then can sell a $1.5c expiring 4/1 and pocket $25-30.";wallstreetbets;2021-03-12 09:02:44

I am nobody special, just sharing some links and personal insight on an interesting and widely relevant cultural phenomenon being fostered online lately.  The subculture found at¬†https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/ seems to¬†lead many traders in what has become very clearly a call to unity. Flooded with memes, GIFs, and other captioned images in a fisco-political comedy style, the main spotlight is on the nostalgic Gamestop (GME), and as has been heard, already their value has raised from ~$40 to over $400 in a matter of days,¬†before¬†shaking up other mass medias. The stock has been extremely volatile,  yet grows stronger at its base, its floor rising slowly yet steadily.


Some of the leaders and most experienced members have shared detailed information¬†about the meaning behind the calls to buy. To me,  it seems there is a trust in strangers that others will call to buy too, reflecting not as much care for the money, gained or lost, but the value of the trust the community reflects within and throughout itself, and among a widely diverse group of free-standing¬†anonymous¬†people. For a growing number of people, GME has come to represent that trust, as a flag would represent a nation. 


Many people lack funds to buy, however, with as many people as there are who would buy into the meaning of community (especially in times of mass isolation), and considering the fact that all of them will have a sudden influx of currency with the stimulus, it seems to be a shared belief that GME will rise and fall and rise again, like a series of rockets, yet with a steady increase of base value. If i am correct, the term ""Diamond hands"" refers to individuals who buy and call to buy ahead, and most importantly hold the stock as tightly as they would a flag for one's own freedom. Holding it as though their hands were made of diamond. These intrinsic values are shared in doing so.


I know nothing,  but I personally expect to see a series of jumps and crashes in the market starting on the first deposit day, and this after being low the day before. Since the collection of pocket-broker apps and consumer-end trading softwares, such as Robinhood, Cash, and more (best ones are listed on one particular post (link?) are not designed to handle that high level of trade. Furthermore, there seems to be general consensus of stock manipulation by major hedge funds. Very unusual factors of the instability of the stock. 

Like a flag in a storm, GME rises. Other¬†stocks of companies, especially those which offer nostalgia (such as AMC) also are rising for the same cause, but with less coverage.¬†


The stimulus will surge the market like it's supposed to, but with all the new masses of unified citizens presenting themselves as rightful free traders, it will add fuel to their popularly predicted long swell of GME stock value because it is based on a widely held value of community and trust which¬†has otherwise been stifled for a year or longer, until now. Now everybody can be a part of the story of¬†Spartacus¬†or even¬†Mr. Bean.";stocks;2021-03-12 08:32:50

gqo4jc6;BestGermanEver;1;"Hello, fellow investor. I can give you the immediate feedback that I invested into a lot of great Mexican products in my life.

Lots of stakes in Chili con Carne, Tacos, Fajitas, Burritos and the occasional Tequila. 

Paid off nicely, too, if you ask my gut.

Here are my personal opinions on your picks, you have to decide for yourself obviously if you take the leap and invest:

On BB and AMC, those are totally different worlds but rode on the same meme level a while ago.

Be careful especially about the prospects of AMC, it being a highly memed stock in the past few weeks which has bascially pumped its value up to meme levels. The current level looks to be elevated again in anticpation of ""financials"". Set your personal limit on what you feel is a good entry point and stick to the plan. Personally, I'm not sure on that one, but if I'd get it, it would have to be for a long term recovery in light of their reduced but still high debt levels and insecure future.

BB is probably the more solid future story. The current level seems to be the ""bottom line"" consensus of the wider market. It has come down from a pumped, meme level spike, so be mindful of where you want to enter. Long term for sure.

Oil has been written off for dead several times already... but it never died. It will transition ""one day"" (whenever that might be) but we still run on it. So it will be a rock solid part of your total portfolio for the foreseeable future.

No idea on Element 25. It's a bet on resources, which can go every which way near to mid-term. Anything to do with ""Batteries"" is of course a bet on future EV and Robotics, so your guess will be as good as anyone's. Long term if you believe in it.";stocks;2021-03-12 07:57:58

Its riding on the coattails of GME, however they now have a foundation for growth. I'd do your own deep research but from my eyes I'm gonna grow $300 at it from taxs and buy some low call optioned long term contracts and hope for tendies.

gqnpszn;RoninOni;1;"Ok, don't string me up for this but....

AMC is truly undervalued right now. It's a goddamn pandemic. It's recovered from the short squeeze that threatened to kill them but their entire business model is in limbo. Once everything reopens and they can fill every seat, AMC is going to have the best boom cinemas have seen since Return of the Jedi.

The fact that there MIGHT be a short squeeze is just cherries on an already tasty pie.

Gamestop... well, it WAS grossly undervalued. DFV was 100% right on that. They also have suffered with restricted retail access but not to the extent that AMC has. They're more fighting the online market, which they've now lined themselves up to combat... so they COULD become a real big player, but that's a bit more of a long shot, and a very long game, and the end value is extremely hard to gauge, but betting against value in 5 years at 3x+ current real mkt value is a pretty big bet. The real bet on gamestop at this point is on the squeeze, which can only happen if diamond fucking hands hold diamond strong.... AND that the game is actually playing out as people are hoping TBQH.... because we can't see anyone elses hands, and there's millions of players with a number of huge players that have better information access than we do (but they also grossly underestimate retard stronk)

As to a squeeze... Well let's clear something up. For an effective short squeeze you really need the price to go way up and shares not available to cover. Doubt either will happen here and even if the price goes up, they will be able to buy easily enough the shares to cover. What I think bears mentioning is that for all the talk about a short squeeze by GME, even last January the Gamma squeeze was likely the major deal. When you look at ASO there is simply not enough options outstanding for a Gamma squeeze.

TL,DR - invest in ASO as it is likely a good company, but don't count on a squeeze like with GME or AMC.";wallstreetbets;2021-03-12 02:56:29

I asked about AMC on here when I was first investing and all I got was that it was after being heavily shorted also, so I figured I'd grab a few and hold, mostly just for a laugh.

From my admittedly limited understanding it's an old and well known company with cinemas allover the world that could be turning a genuine profit.. the pandemic is understandably after hitting it hard too I guess but it's starting to open back up and from a completely personal opinion it was one of the best places to make out when I was younger! I can't see that really changing for other kids!
As for the investment and worldwide interest from like-minded ape nostalgia driven people, probably like myself it seems like something that could go a decent bit higher.

But truth be told,  I probably won't sell anyway!

I'll likely be the one everyone laughs at in 50 years when I post my 2cent AMC shares on here for nostalgia lolz.

I do think Tesla will hit the $1000 mark 'at some point' so I would consider that as a long term investment if I was dropping 90k.

If you really want to see what will happen with AMC watch their management closely, see what decisions they make and keep asking this question: ""do they plan on fundamentally turning around this business?""

gqmky3f;workerbee69;2;"I agree. Pre-covid I didn't care for theaters much, just certain films, but in my town we only have Regals. When they announced closing all theaters, I knew it was my last chance for a long time and saw Tenet showing to 10 people total in the theater (excellent on the big screen btw). Now I'm excited to make the drive to AMC, and hyped for a theater experience. IMO they have been shifting away from quantity to higher per person $$ (the latter supported by info in their earnings call). The upgraded screens, plushy seats, and dining feel like a smart move to focus on distancing from the streaming services. Our Regals sell alcohol now too.

In general, since the pandemic I've shifted my view of spending money a lot. I feel like every dollar I'm spending is helping my local economy and I'm purposefully tipping more, getting add-ons I wouldn't normally, etc. I think movie theaters will be a relatively safe option compared to concerts, packed bars, ""events"", etc.  in the short term future. People want to go back out, and there's a backlog of major movies to look forward to this year. I'm no one to take financial advice from, I invested a few movie tickets worth into AMC in January/February and hope it eventually buys me a few more than I started with.

2. AMC rose and fell sharply with GME yesterday, meaning it was attacked too.

3. The Ceo called the share holders to discuss dilution (tonight or tomorrow?) which most likely won't happen but will call back all synthetic shares theoretically causing a squeeze.

AMC Entertainment (AMC) also grabbed significant attention from users, with shares moving 4% higher the day after it reported better than expected Q4 revenue. Palantir(PLTR) , which along with AMC has been in play on the subreddit for some time, saw its shares jump 7%.

Also grabbing attention was Roblox(RBLX) , which made its market debut on Wednesday through a direct listing on the New York Stock Exchange. Shares Roblox(RBLX) were up 5%.

Perennial fan favorite Tesla (TSLA) also made gains, climbing 4%.

The broader market likewise moved into positive territory. The S&amp;P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average both edged up 1% as the Nasdaq gained 3%.

The equity, according to its latest 8-K, has negative book value.

Yesterday when GME was on a steady increase for three hours, I decided to buy in at $330, then it plummeted to $280 seconds later so I bought more, and then it sunk to $198 in about five minutes.

That does not mean that they issue the shares, it means they have the ability to issue the shares.

Since the share count is absurdly high, share holders will probably vote no.

But: This means a share count is on now.

Might be a political move to expose short sellers.

gqlkxdy;skilliard7;1;"Small cap and value stocks have consistently out performed the market for more than 100 years. 

VTI provides excess exposure to large caps, which trail the market. Less than 4% of VTI is invested in companies that are not in the S&amp;P 500. So in other words, just ~15% of the companies make up 96% of the funds assets.

In the short/recent term, the growth of large cap growth, and by correlation VTI, has been much larger than small cap value. Small cap value is still below pre-pandemic highs, whereas VTI is up roughly 20%. Over the past 10 years there is even more of a disconnect. The valuations of the largest companies are not driven by earnings, they are driven by speculation and high expectations. It would take tremendous performance for many of these companies to beat the market over the long term moving forward.

&gt;Just do VTI and stop overthinking. The market has heard the bull and bear case for each of your concerns and has priced those sectors as efficiently as it can

There are factors that keep institutions out of small cap. For example, if a fund has $100 Billion in assets, if they want to invest in a $200 Million company, they could probably only buy $10 million in shares without pumping up the price. This would be so insignificant that they wouldn't bother even if the company does seem undervalued, as it would only be 0.01% of assets.

Secondly, as market-cap weighted index funds grow in popularity, large cap stocks systematically increase in value, as most capital inflows go to large companies regardless of performance.

Then lastly, there's been a huge emotional shift towards growth. Whether its because investors prefer companies that grow under the ""new normal""(ie zoom), or if it's because they are buying into a ""comeback story"" (IE GME, AMC).

I don't intend on going all in on value or small cap, I'm just looking for the right amount to diversify. By investing in VTI, you're putting 23.6% of your net worth into 10 companies, 5 or 6 of which are in a single industry(tech)

In the tech bubble, tech brought down the entire market due to their prior valuations. If you had been a value investor, you barely would've lost anything. But the overall market was down something like 60-70% due to tech, and crashed in 2008/2009, meaning it basically traded sideways for over a decade.";financialindependence;2021-03-11 18:16:29

With that said, AMC converted $600M in debt to 44.4M shares on January 28th, the day after it squeezed up to ~$20 after being sub $5 all year. The following day, shares fell over 50% on news of the dilution, which killed the squeeze and hurt the shareholders who were bidding up the price.

The bonuses were announced February 28th and the CEO‚Äôs bonus was actually $3.75M.

What I believe happened:

‚ÄúAn institutional investor sold their shares to buy back in at the bottom‚Äù

It explains the immediate, massive drop, and the subsequent huge rebound. I‚Äôm sure plenty of paper hands sold on the way down as well, assisting the drop.  The conflict with this is AMC mimicking GME‚Äôs drop. That could be explained by them also owning AMC, but not buying back in to it.

I believe an institutional investor sold all of their GME stock and then bought back in at the bottom. It explains the sudden drop and the quick rebound. As much as I love you apes, I don‚Äôt think enough people bought enough shares at the dip to bounce it back up $80 so quickly. If true, this is a good thing, I‚Äôd welcome someone with that form of investment holding. It also gives credibility to the fact that we are going to rocket at some point or they most likely wouldn‚Äôt have bought back in.

&gt;‚Äú**This is not a Reddit meme stock ETF**,‚Äù said Jamie Wise, CEO of Buzz Holdings and the originator of the index. ‚ÄúThis is about the broader conversation around stocks mentioned on social media platforms. We are using broad social media sources, principally Twitter and StockTwits.‚Äù Wise said it also uses Yahoo Finance, Benzinga and Reddit.
&gt;Initially, the largest holdings include Twitter, DraftKings, Ford, American Airlines, and Facebook. Tesla is number 10. The $5 billion minimum market cap criteria would exclude Reddit names like Gamestop, Express or AMC Entertainment from the mix.

&gt;Wise says the stocks in the index are proof they are not chasing the latest Reddit craze. ‚ÄúThese are not the kind of stocks that are being promoted by celebrities,‚Äù Wise said. ‚ÄúThese are everyday stocks being promoted by people with a wide variety of viewpoints, and is not focused on a narrow group of Reddit names.‚Äù

gqki608;nicheComicsProject;1;"&gt;It is the same thing.  You could have $350k in your hand with the click of a button.  Then you would be faced with whether to reinvest it at the current level or say buy Tesla at the current level.

I'm not sure what you're saying.  If they bought in at $350 they could have had $350k in their hand by just not buying in at such a silly price.  But if they bought in at $40 then sure, now would be a great time to get out but even if they mess around and let it drop all the way to $80 they still double their money.

&gt;If you wouldn‚Äôt put in $350k today then pull it out and leave in whatever you would put in at the current level. Everything else is speculation.

That's what keeps me out.  I want in on the action but there's no way I'm paying $350 for a stock that's worth maybe 1/10th of that.  Same with AMC, I'd like to be in on the action but the company is dead and just doesn't know it yet.  No way I'm paying $10 for a company with no future.  People on here talk about how much money they're going to make when people can go to the theatres again and that could be but that has nothing to do with the stock price.

&gt;You are still ripping the hedge funds off by doing so. You have no idea how many of the posts here are bots telling people to stay in so they can sell off. Why did it shoot up from $50 all the sudden 2 weeks ago? You think retail did that or was it someone who stands to 5-10x their money based on knowing the hype train will pile on.

Absolutely.  Personally I think this whole short story is a bunch of nonsense.  Stories from how things worked decades ago.  Today there are no guys with big egos on the phone making buys.  There are algorithms doing their thing.  Some algos might have overcommitted into short positions and left themselves exposed to an event they were never trained on but they also learned from the previous action and are making money now.  They probably learned that with GME and AMC they can bump the price and get the price to jump.  I suspect the massive dip yesterday was them dumping most of their positions after they determined they'd gotten all they could out of it.

&gt;I have paper hands like a bitch last time but I was using house refinance money that I couldn‚Äôt afford to lose so I had no choice, this time is using a more practical amount, I‚Äôm already up several months salary so that‚Äôs something.

Sounds like you're doing better than nearly everyone here.  Just make sure you take some of those gains out for your other projects and don't get tempted to risk them again.  Remember the line from Wolf of Wallstreet: ""we don't give back gains"".

&gt;Feel free to hold all you want but please don‚Äôt buy any more, it could go to $100 tomorrow.

If the volatility would drop a bit I'd be buying calls at $90.  I expect it to hit less than $50 before months end.";wallstreetbets;2021-03-11 13:15:00

As i kept returning more frequently this year, three letters kept catching my eye, g, m and e.  Then the first sky rocket to $400+ happened.  

I go home to my apartment and i'm telling my wife about it, our son(14) hears me and comes out from his room and says 'stonks'.  Thats it, thats enough for me, i'm gonna figure this shit out!  

About 4 business days later I have my first trader account with a broker app and a very modest balance.  We buy a gme share a couple amc shares and a couple clean energy type shares, clne was kinda looking interesting.  My son did all the purchases as i was at work and hes doing half his grade 9 at home, i thought it would be cool parenting to let him handle the dips and such since i didnt have anyone to show me that shit when i was his age (my dad was a drug traffiker).

Since then we have bought a few more amc (9) and one more gme (2) and a few more different cheaper than a dollar shares, we're holding until they reach astronomical levels and then we will sell 1 gme and 8 amc.  That is our families plan.

The stock market has always profited on FOMO and those feelings of   
maybe I should ride this higher.  Getting in on the ground floor requires serious DD.  Not reading a forum or jumping on a band wagon.  GME &amp; AMC are very unique situations.   You will always have that ""I could have made this much"" feeling in the stock market because your peak price is only going to last a minute or two before it goes down...

It's not a question of what is the peak price.  It's a question of how much are you willing to make or loose.  Find your price point.  Be comfortable with it, and accept that you made the best choice based on that moment of time.  Sometimes what I do is screenshot the chart the minute I sell and remind myself that based on everything I knew at that moment..  This was the best time for me to get out...  

Final thought if you're new to this:  Don't bail out if the stock crashes.  I took a 50% loss in value once for 6 months before recovering.  If you don't need the money (which you shouldn't if you are invested in a stock) then don't sell unless you are making a profit or there is zero hope of recovery (bankruptcy/damning news) even then I sell covered calls until I've made enough to sell at a comfortable price.

AMC (ticker: AMC), the largest movie theater chain in the world, posted revenue of $162.5 million in the fourth quarter, surpassing the average expectation of $142.3 million, according to the analysts tracked by FactSet.

The per-share loss for the quarter was $3.15 after charges. Analysts expected an adjusted loss of $3.24 a share.

Shares of AMC jumped 8% in after-hours trading after whipsawing around during the trading session, ending down 6%. They are up 134% over one year compared with the 35% gain in the S&amp;P 500 in the period.

For the full year 2020, AMC reported revenue of $1.24 billion and a per-share loss of $16.15. Analysts expected a loss of $31.18 a share on sales of $1.2 billion, according to FactSet.

Adam Aron, AMC's CEO, said he was optimistic about the continued recovery of the business, noting that moviegoers in critical Southern California markets like Los Angeles would soon be able to return to the theater.

AMC has raised more than $1 billion in cash since the fall to build a buffer against business interruptions. ""This past year has presented AMC with the most challenging market conditions in the 100-year history of the company,"" Aron said in a statement.

With vaccinations spreading in the U.S., more theaters reopening (including New York City last weekend), and a calendar of blockbuster movie releases up ahead, ""we have reason to be optimistic about AMC's ability to get to the other side of this pandemic,"" Aron said.

For the full year 2019, AMC reported a loss of $1.08 a share on sales of $5.55 billion.";wallstreetbets;2021-03-11 05:36:38

If you sold the option, theta would chip away at the value of the option, so you could close your position and make the premium- buyback.

Like I sold a RKT 35C 3/19 for 1.35$. The stock moved lower and the option went to 0.1$, I close the position to cover my position and sell another call to collect more premium.

I have been dancing the last two weeks and have lowered my cost basis 1.39$ for AMC and 3$ for RKT including the 1.1 dividend.

gqj10so;EthanCoxMTL;10;"Hi gang. I‚Äôm an editor with a media outlet, so I wanted to weigh in on this. I should also mention my positions: GME 2@$190 and AMC 16@$8.20. Don‚Äôt laugh, media workers are broke as hell. Our industry is fucked. But I‚Äôm along for the ride.

I absolutely believe that HFs are pulling every dirty trick they can think of, but this post is predicated on a misunderstanding of the mechanics of how media report news.

Almost every news story you read has been updated and edited since it was published. This means it may include information that wasn‚Äôt available at the time of publication because that information was subsequently added.

So, as someone who works in media, here‚Äôs what I see:

1.	‚Å†An article about GME was posted 14 hours prior. No one knows what the content of that article was then, but it probably didn‚Äôt predict today‚Äôs market.

2.	‚Å†That article, at the same URL, was rewritten over the course of the day to reflect developments. So the article might have been released before the drop, but that doesn‚Äôt mean the part of it describing the drop was in it when it was published. That would have been edited in as it happened.

3.	‚Å†This is industry standard for any kind of breaking news. You publish a short story saying something happened, then add to it as you find more.

Imagine a hypothetical terrorist attack happens at ten AM. A report is published, saying little more than that it happened. As more information becomes available, the article is updated. You look at it at 3 PM and note that it includes the detail that a suspect was caught at 2 PM but the article was published at 10 AM. Do you assume the newspaper had advance knowledge of the arrest? Or do you assume the newspaper updated its story?

There‚Äôs lots of shady nonsense going on, but I‚Äôm afraid these details aren‚Äôt proof of anything.

I like the stonk. I understand the anger at shenanigans, I just wanted to set the record straight on this issue. May the tendyman come for you all.";wallstreetbets;2021-03-11 03:22:50

-3% premium per month soft cap for selling cash secured puts, whatever looks the best with a delta of 0.30 for covered calls

-starting with 30 DTE, no later, but maybe earlier depending on the perceived rate of decay between weeks

-aiming for strike prices I wouldn't mind getting exercised for, caring even less if it's a covered call

-have a limit order to buy the covered call or cash secured put back for half the premium (unless it's super illiquid or they don't have weekly options), adjusting it when half of the duration has ran out to leave open the potential to get 1.5% of the collateral in premiums in just a week or something

This held true for all the others too (I didn't include them all on the pic but feel free to check for yourself): They all had similar patterns starting at noon (including GME), but then GME behaved totally differently and spewed 8% in a minute. *Then a minute later*, the others lost more. The only one I've seen that happened in the same minute as GME is AMC.

AMC I think went from 107 million shares outstanding to about 460 million shares outstanding.

If we take the 12/31/19 price of about $14 per share, with the dilution that would be like $3.25 now.

Regardless of the exact math, there is no question based on comparison to the past AMC is overpriced now.

That was wrong.  It would put people out of work and theaters out of business, none of which we want to see. Now that the squeeze is on it means that we will also all make money when the HF is forced to buy all of our stock at an incredibly inflated price. Which is just icing on the cake after we helped keep them from killing these companies. 

Also traditionally when a company is having trouble, keeping their ceo is important, so they give them a benefit in stock options, which is what he got. Which means that he profits when we profit. He used the extra money generated by the stock sell off to restructure their debt and other beneficial things for the company as a whole. He has done very well and is going to bring AMC through with the help of us apes. 

Added benefit teaching the HF a lesson that us apes are important and that gambling with peoples lives and livelihoods for the sake of profit is wrong.

The bite that AMC loses after that 3 weekend exclusivity window is pretty small, thus not really effecting the AMC revenue all that much. (This is also noting that most profit is made on concessions anyway)

-AMC elimated 600 million in debt with Silverlake in exchange for 44 million shares valued at $13.64 each
-There are 450.2 million shares outstanding today

Now compare the number of outstanding shareswith the number of attributed shares, adding the 44 million created in the Silverlake. The number of outstanding shares also includes share traded over the last few day that just haven't cleared yet, and there may be other factors affecting this number that I'm not aware of, but even so, it's clear that AMC is still being heavily shorted, likely more than the published short interest figues whould claim.

gqi9mdi;NorthernLeaf;17;"AMC needs to shift from just movies to showing sports, e-sports, TV shows, etc.

Probably like 10 years ago, I remember when there were some movie theatres in Toronto showing the Maple Leafs NHL games for a little while. That shit was so much fun! Amazing picture and sound quality, and it was tons of fun watching the game there with my friends (we obviously snuck in some alcohol). 

Imagine watching UFC fights at a movie theatre where they serve alcohol and food. It would be insane! The problem with a lot of sports bars is that even bars dedicated to sports don't have enough seats with a good view of a good quality TV. 

You get people in there watching sports and other types of things, all of a sudden it becomes a cool place to hang out again. People will play arcade games and hang out around the concession stands and stuff like that. 

I think movies are dead. I used to love seeing movies, and now there aren't any that I even want to see. I think The Force Awakens was the last movie I saw in theaters. I much prefer watching TV shows which are much better quality than they used to be.";wallstreetbets;2021-03-10 23:21:19
gqi9mcj;blakexton;43;Ya see for me, I had no money when I first saw the hype. I told my girlfriend to invest as much as she could into GameStop at $30, she got 3 shares. The next day they were worth $60 so she got another 7 and we were both hype as shit. She held through everything, even bought AMC cause why the fuck not. It went to it's peak, went down to $40 and my broke ass managed to grab 2.3 shares when I had some spare money at $70 when it went back up. If my 2.3 shares even went to $500 a piece I could pay off 2 debts, and get some things for my new home! Or a new guitar. Or guitar stuff. Either way. For my girlfriend she would have 5k! She could also pay off debts and do so much else with the remaining money. That for us is life changing.;wallstreetbets;2021-03-10 23:21:19

gqi9dsp;MUPleasFlyAgain;25;"&gt;Are we just going to ignore that GME and AMC both had an extreme dip at the same time?

This isn't new, the reason was already exposed long ago. They hide their shorting through shorting retail ETFs containing GME instead, which was why the price chart is so close to each other. In fact, BBBY is closer to GME than AMC does. Look at all the retail stocks, most of them were basically the same.

The ETF they shorted today was this one: https://fintel.io/ss/us/retl

&gt;And that some media was reporting the GME drop before it happened?

They've been doing that since the gigantic dip, every small rise was called ""last ditch effort from losers""";wallstreetbets;2021-03-10 23:19:20

gqi9c14;Donkeyotee3;1;"I was looking at level II and it looked like the sell orders were set in chunks of 100 sold at a tiny bit less than the previous 100. 

I'm just a retard but I'm guessing that this is how someone would structure a large sell order so that they can get the entire order out for an average price. 

Or it could have been shorted shares for all I know. I did also notice during one of the halts that there were far more buy orders than sell orders in the time that it was dropping. I'm guessing that since buys are routed to the best offer price that unloading downward like the with decreased bids would naturally drop the price even if there was a large demand. 

Consider this though, if someone is shorting shares wouldn't they want to get the maximum value for their shorted shares? It should be obvious by now that pushing the price down on purpose wouldn't shake GME true believers at this point. 

But I think it would be moronic to take a large short position on this security at this point with the cult like status it had earned. 

My AMC tanked at the same time as well.

My opinion: 

AMC: still very high chance of going bankrupt..therefore I would not touch it.

GME: Stock price before all the WSB Meme Stuff startet (like before Q4 2020) was around 20$, heavily pushed down by shorts. 

Since then, from a fundamental viewpoint nothing bad happend. I can¬¥t assume how all the media presence and the downpush through shorts affect the stockprice upside (fundamental speaking), but I see the midterm bottom at least at 25-30, probably highter.";StockMarket;2021-03-10 22:51:59

Step 1: Decide to wheel trade AMC.

Step 2: Open a narrow put debit spread to collect more premium (proportionately) with $100 in collateral than you would with $700 in collateral.

Step 3: Either wait for the credit spread to expire worthless, or if it looks like you'll be assigned toss in extra money for the collateral and sell the long put.

If it works, you get more premium proportionately while you do something else with the collateral. If you get assigned, you get to do stuff with the collateral on all the intervening days and get your profits from selling the long put to make it slightly more profitable than getting assigned normally while wheel trading.

So the short answer is no, you shouldn‚Äôt set a strike price below what you bought them for. 

There is one exception: if I bought 100 shares of AMC at $11 but I think it‚Äôs going to tank to $8 before the contract expires then I could buy a $9 contract and just keep the premium that I would make to help hedge the loss.

&gt;Expectations do not form out of a vacuum

That is essentially said what I am saying when I say, ""Of course those expectations can be effected by how they've done compared to the past."" Expectations come from many sources. Really my only point is that the fact that AMC will likely experience an increase in revenue the year after a pandemic doesn't necessarily mean anything for the long term prospects of the stock without more context. Everyone knows that their revenue will go up. The question is how much will it go up and how sustainable is their revenue long term and how will they handle the additional debt they took on.";stocks;2021-03-10 21:01:46

gqhpp92;Trevonious;2065;"My explanation for why there was such a large dip:

Volume was WAY too low to cause such a huge drop in price, so I asked in GME Megathread Part 1, ""How could that large of a dip happen, with such a low volume?"", also pointing out that IBorrowDesk didn't report any new shorts, during the time of the dip. I didn't realize that when shorts are borrowed, the borrower has 3 days to use them, or they have to be returned. Shorts HAVE been borrowed, in large numbers, over the past few days. That means that hedgies were borrowing shorted shares, iron handing them, borrowing more, and then they released them all at once (or in large chunks because of the halts). That allowed them to tank the price in a very direct and focused manner, say $160 in a matter of 20 minutes (and that includes the halt times). I believe this was an attempt to trigger stop losses and scare day-traders into selling. The immediate rebound and the fact that THE EXACT SAME THING HAPPENED TO AMC, AT THE SAME TIME, seems to corroborate this theory.

Thanks to /u/_Exordium
, for explaining this rule for borrowing shorts!

220@$125.61 average

TLDR: Since there has been millions of shares shorted over the past few days, and they have 3 days to use the shorted shares, I think that the dip was caused by hedgies hoarding shorts to release all at once. Thus tanking the price and triggering stop losses and scaring day-traders into paperhanding. Also, exact same tactic used on AMC, at the exact same time.";wallstreetbets;2021-03-10 20:49:04
gqhpp5n;Objective_Suspect122;47;today, the iborrowdesk showed a decrease of 750.000 shares, and amc has an identical chart at the same time, so yes, imo that was defintely a delay/stalling attack for whatever hedging plan they have cooked up, but in doing so, they showed where their margin call is.. i'm guessing around 400-450.. after that level , it should take off..;wallstreetbets;2021-03-10 20:49:03

An example would be an algo trading on meme tickers that sees a sharp downtick in GME or a big change in the order book and uses that as a trigger to sell off AMC, BB, or NOK.

One thing that AMC has done incredibly well is see the writing on the wall, and realize that going to movies for people needs to be an ""experience"" now. They have a difficult time competing with the at-home market, and I think they realized that. So they've transformed many of their locations by including the reclining seating, bars, and other things. I really do hope they are able to continue the transformation so that the theater becomes a center for the community to gather and have that experience.

A great example of this is the Emagine theater close to me. Not only do they have the same seating and bar, but they have a sit down eatery and a bowling alley. Becoming a centralized hub of entertainment and not just movies is really the way to go.";wallstreetbets;2021-03-10 19:25:56

It‚Äôs not. 

GME and AMC at this point are intrinsically linked. People who panic sell GME are going to panic sell AMC. 

AMC is basically going to ride the coattails of whatever GME does at this point, whether is dips or rises. GME and AMC are in the same boat (companies that took a big hit in 2020) , owned by the same people,  shorted by the same people, both have public attention and are the two most popular memestocks.

Either way I'd hold so long as you don't need to pull out. Me personally, I don't see it going above $14 again for awhile, but if they were bought by another company I'd bet on a buyout/share being worth more

gqgfuqu;CalebTGordan;1;"Adding my own ‚ÄúWhat this means‚Äù

HF already have billions and losing won‚Äôt mean they won‚Äôt know where the next meal comes from. It just means they have to sell off some billion dollar assets they barely use to cover losses. 

For my wife and I, it means independence. We were extremely lucky and got a decent windfall that we didn‚Äôt need to use right away but we are in a living situation we need out of as soon as we can manage. That windfall gets us close to the goal of moving but not there. I put most of it (Only risk what you are willing to lose) into GME and AMC. We just doubled the GME investment today (the windfall came in just as GME crossed $100 üò´. I wanted to get in at $50). And our total investment should be doubled by the end of the week. 

If this keeps up at this pace, we will not only be able to move but will be debt free, will be able to afford a couple medical things, and (if we do hit Mars) we might even be able to buy a house. 

This means a whole new life of security, peace, and independence. If this fails, we lose a couple months in our plan and I take extra shifts.";wallstreetbets;2021-03-10 15:47:51

Pay $1150 and receive 100 shares, then sell for 0.45c profit each ($45 profit, but I paid $41 for the call)

Sell the option for $200, which gives me a flat $150 in profit.

gqgcsc8;ionized_fallout;8;"March 10 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks jumped on Wednesday with the Dow hitting a record high, as data showed underlying consumer prices remained tepid in February, easing concerns about a spike in inflation.

The 10-year U.S. Treasury yield slipped from its session highs as data showed core consumer prices index, which excludes volatile items such as food and energy, rose less than expected last month.

Focus is on an auction of U.S. 10-year and 30-year debt later in the day for clues to where yields in the recently volatile market may be headed.

""Expectations for near-term inflation to rise is going to remain due to the huge public borrowings, but the tame inflation data that has come today would definitely drive some optimism among investors,"" said Arthur Weise, chief investment officer at Kingsland Growth Advisors in New York.

Accelerated vaccine rollouts and a new hefty round of fiscal stimulus on the horizon have raised bets on higher inflation, triggering a sharp rise in Treasury yields that knocked off the tech-heavy Nasdaq about 7% from its Feb. 12 record closing high.

The United States plans to double its order of the single-shot Johnson &amp; Johnson(JNJ) coronavirus vaccine, procuring an additional 100 million doses, a White House official said on Wednesday.

The Nasdaq extended gains after logging its best one-day percentage jump in four months on Tuesday, helped by a near 20% jump in Tesla Inc's(TSLA) shares as investors picked up momentum stocks that had recently taken a beating due to higher yields.

Amazon.com Inc (AMZN), Microsoft Corp(MSFT) and Tesla extended gains by 0.8% and 4% from the previous session, while economy-linked industrial and financial stocks jumped more than 1% each.

The chunk of a $1.9 trillion relief aid, which is on track to be signed into law later this week, is poised to end up in the stock market and could provide a boost for GameStop(GME) and other stocks popular among retail investors active in online social media forums.

Shares of GameStop(GME) jumped another 19%, setting the videogame retailer on track for its longest streak of daily gains in six months and extending a rally that has already doubled the company's market value.

Among other ""meme"" stocks, Koss Corp(KOSS) and AMC Entertainment(AMC) climbed 52% and 14%.

Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 4.2-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and by a 4.1-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq.

The S&amp;P 500 posted 20 new 52-week highs and no new low, while the Nasdaq recorded 174 new highs and 10 new lows. (Reporting by Medha Singh and Shashank Nayar in Bengaluru; Editing by Maju Samuel)";wallstreetbets;2021-03-10 15:25:17

QUOTES AS OF 09:48:20 AM ET 03/10/2021  
09:46 AM EST, 03/10/2021 (MT Newswires) -- GameStop(GME) and AMC Entertainment(AMC) , both higher in Wednesday's early regular session, continue to lead mention counts among the WallStreetBets Reddit crowd, but EV stocks led by Tesla (TSLA) and Nio (NIO) are seeing significant herd momentum on the upside.

Tesla and Nio both popped at the open followed by gains in Li Auto(LI) , Xpeng(XPEV) and Plug Power(PLUG) .

Elsewhere, volume interest has been spiking in the cannabis category, with Aphria(APHA) , Tilray(TLRY) and Aurora Cannabis(ACB) recording a jump in average share volume over the last day.

ARK Innovation ETF (ARKK) is up about 1% early Wednesday after soaring more than 10% Tuesday.

Continue watching Palantir(PLTR) as its mention count and share volume interest has been growing.

gqg4tgx;ionized_fallout;1;"(Reuters) - Shares of GameStop(GME) surged in early deals on Wednesday, putting the videogame retailer on track for its longest streak of daily gains in six months, while many other ""meme stocks"" posted double-digit gains. 

Market strategists have said tens of billions of dollars of U.S. President Joe Biden's coronavirus relief package could indirectly find their way into shares, possibly boosting ""meme stocks"" that are heavily promoted by retail traders in online social media forums.

GameStop (GME) was trading 14.5% higher at $282.73 before the bell, on course for a sixth straight session of gains, while shares of cinema operator AMC Entertainment(AMC) rose 10% and headphones maker Koss Corp(KOSS) soared about 40%. 

Germany-listed shares of GameStop(GME) jumped over 20%, with data from brokerage Lang &amp; Schwarz showing the scrip to be the third-most traded stock by turnover on its platform. 

GameStop (GME) retains a legion of devout followers after a social media frenzy in January triggered a massive rally in which its shares surged more than 1,600%. 

That spike triggered a short squeeze that shook hedge funds such as Melvin Capital, which were forced to cover their positions on GameStop(GME).

* GameStop(GME) set for longest winning streak in six months

* Futures up: Dow 0.55%, S&amp;P 0.40%, Nasdaq 0.59% (Adds comment, details; updates prices)

By Medha Singh and Shashank Nayar

March 10 (Reuters) - Major U.S. stock indexes were set to open higher on Wednesday after data showed underlying consumer prices remained tepid in February, easing concerns about a spike in inflation as an economic recovery gathers momentum.

The 10-year U.S. Treasury yield ticked lower as data showed core consumer prices index inflation rose less than expected as demand for services including airline travel gradually picked up.

Focus is on an auction of U.S. 10-year and 30-year debt later in the day for clues to where yields in the recently volatile market may be headed.

""Expectations for near-term inflation to rise is going to remain due to the huge public borrowings, but the tame inflation data that has come today would definitely drive some optimism among investors,"" said Arthur Weise, chief investment officer at Kingsland Growth Advisors in New York.

At 8:52 a.m. ET, Dow E-minis were up 176 points, or 0.55%, S&amp;P 500 E-minis were up 15.5 points, or 0.4% and Nasdaq 100 E-minis were up 75.5 points, or 0.59%.

Accelerated vaccine rollouts and a new hefty round of fiscal stimulus on the horizon have raised bets on higher inflation, triggering a sharp rise in Treasury yields that knocked off the tech-heavy Nasdaq about 7% from its Feb. 12 record closing high. The Nasdaq logged its best one-day percentage jump in four months on Tuesday, helped by a near 20% jump in Tesla Inc's(TSLA) shares as investors picked up momentum stocks that had recently taken a beating due to higher yields.

Apple Inc (AAPL), Amazon.com Inc(AMZN) and Microsoft Corp(MSFT) extended gains slightly from the previous session, while economy-linked industrial and bank stocks including Boeing Co(BA), Morgan Stanley(MS) and JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co(JPM) also added between 0.8% and 1.2%.

The chunk of a $1.9 trillion relief aid, which is on track to be signed into law later this week, is poised to end up in the stock market and could provide a boost for GameStop(GME) and other stocks popular among retail investors active in online social media forums.

Shares of GameStop(GME) jumped another 12%, setting the videogame retailer on track for its longest streak of daily gains in six months and extending a rally that has already doubled the company's market value.

Among other ""meme"" stocks, Koss Corp(KOSS) and AMC Entertainment(AMC) climbed 44% and 7.4%. (Reporting by Medha Singh and Shashank Nayar in Bengaluru; Editing by Maju Samuel)";wallstreetbets;2021-03-10 14:09:30

In the last year, after suffering from a few ischemic strokes and undergoing heart surgery, I watched how the stress of trying to keep up with everything by ""doing everything right"" as far as ""the American dream"" goes- took such a massive toll on his body and mind. The day after his FMLA ran out he was supposed to return to work.. but was informed instead that they had already replaced his position (they had found a legal way to do this without any severance). Of course that meant for him a gap in health insurance, and him scrambling to figure out how he was going to pay these bills.

AMC/BB were never short plays, they were just people who FOMO‚Äôd after GME skyrocketed and wanted to look for the ‚Äúnext GME‚Äù without analyzing the underlying fundamentals of the situation.  Wild price fluctuations in both were simply due to retail investors frenzy.

gqfs5z4;Little_Tony_Danza;1;I kind of don‚Äôt understand it but here‚Äôs from what I can gather. Essentially AMC is shorted because hedges thought they were gonna eat shit due to covid, there‚Äôs more shares shorted than exist which is similar to the GME Situation. Hedges borrowed shares and loaned them to other people for shorting, but now all the shares are going to be called back to their owners due to a stock holders meeting, which could cause a short squeeze. Something along those lines;wallstreetbets;2021-03-10 12:18:10

gqfrffh;Obvious_Equivalent_1;1;"&gt;DR: My theory is that HF are manipulating the page to divert attention from AMC to GME so that they don't have to cover TENS OF BILLIONS IN SHORTS. We have seen AMC stop following the same trends as GME in the past week, after weeks of being damn near the same graph. AMC continues to go up in % of volume shorted while GME is easing off short volume (IK WHY, BUT STILL LOOK AT MY POINTS) AMC IS NOT FORGOTTEN APES!!!

So they staged off the game squeeze, but the majority of the short squeeze still hasn‚Äôt happened. On paper, nobody knows for sure how far this thing can go, but I think that the bottom of that guesstimated peak starts at where the last spike ended...$483. And if that‚Äôs the bottom, those hope of $1000/share don‚Äôt seem that ludicrous. The bigger estimates of $4000 and $5000 might be possible.

Saw some bullshit like this on AMC tonight.

This dude bought SOMETHING.  Damn sure ain't GME.

If he bought 114 shares @ 223.05/share he initially invested $25428.12.  

-81.8% of $25428.12 is -$20800.20 (i'll leave pennies discrepency to rounding).

$25428.12 - $20800.20 = $4627.92 (again rounding discrepancy.

This agrees with above.

So, how did he lose a fucking $20,800.20, buying GME @ $223.05 with today's GME close....ANY price of GME today?

gqel34h;wokeinthematrix;25;"I HIGHLY regret not buying at $40. I thought it was all over. I wish I could go back in time and put in $5,000 or more, it obviously would have been well worth it.

Now I have a measly 10 shares that I bought at $160. I regret listening to all of the ‚Äúfinancial professionals‚Äù saying to stay away from GME.

I have shitty employment, and less than a year before I probably can‚Äôt afford health insurance and the medicine withdrawal may kill me, possibly even literally.

I also am just not looking forward to a lifetime of working 40+ hours a week, it‚Äôs a huge waste of life, and I‚Äôve never gotten to enjoy life much.

I believe everyone saying to stay away from GME just wants to keep the rich rich, and the poor poor (especially if they are very wealthy hedge fund managers, who lose money when you make money).

Other people are just ignorant of how GME works.

I should have put a lot more of my savings in at $40, I should havd listened to all of you saying it would go up, but instead I listened to the ‚Äúprofessionals‚Äù.

I could have made $30, $40, maybe even $50,000 before the end of the year! Possibly much more! Then I could finally start my fucking life and be left alone from people when I want to be alone!

I‚Äôm afraid GME might honestly be a once in a lifetime opportunity. Playing it safe has done nothing but hold me back in life. You only get ahead in life by taking risks. 

There has to be more opportunities to make a good 5-6 figures BEFORE THE END OF THE YEAR, RIGHT?????

gqeg6f1;Jef_Wheaton;1;CashApp only allows trading on certain stocks, but currently both GME  and AMC are on the list. Their interface has a delay, so the price on RH is a few seconds ahead of CA. (I have $1 in RH, I just use it for the pretty lists. I use Fidelity for actual trading, and a little bit on CA.) They only allow purchases in dollar amounts, not shares, so you wind up with weird fractionals.

I think it‚Äôs entirely possible Disney releases childrens‚Äô movies exclusively on D+ and ‚Äúadult‚Äù movies (no not that kind, I mean like Marvel) in theaters. Reason being that adults can enjoy the high quality and will want to experience it in the best form possible. D+ kids‚Äô movies could be amazing.

I have enough savings for some more aggressive short-term plays in the hopes of making a good amount in the next couple years, but I don't want to blow too much of my nest egg because I'm disabled and have limited earning potential going forward. 

Most advice for my age group (mid-30s) focuses on long-term earnings from steady income. I don't have steady income and I'm not sure yet what my lifespan will be. I want to enjoy some independence while I still can and make the most of savings I've been sitting on. I'm in the US. 

More details:

* I need to know the bulk of my money is safe but can play around with maybe 10-20K, put the rest in something low risk and keep enough cash for emergencies.
* Current holdings: Most is in high yield savings through Discover (only .5 APY right now though). 10K in Wealthfront EFTs (7.5 risk), 2K individual stocks (some meme like GME and AMC, bitcoin, as well as APPL, SNE, SHOP, PW, IIPR, NTDOY). I just got started investing a few months ago

Don‚Äôt forgot, those dumb hedge funds have not paid back the millions of AMC shares they shorted which will cause AMC to skyrocket as well. Right now, they are paying a daily 12% interest until they buy back all the shares. The interest is expected to increase to 20% by the end of March or beginning of April. At that point, the hedge funds have to buy back the shares or lose a ton of money. Diamond Handsüíéüíéüôåüèºüôåüèº;wallstreetbets;2021-03-10 00:44:11

AMC (the theater chain not the network) will never get into the streaming game because that‚Äôs not their business model, they don‚Äôt have the knowledge or infrastructure to support it, and so far have given zero indication that said strategy is even in their future. 

I like AMC because the American economy will be coming back online within the next six months and folks (like most of us here) want to go to a movie theater.

My interpretation of the latter is that the return to business is already somewhat priced in so you *need* a gamma squeeze to make money. Whereas GME has been leveraging all this fun to fundamentally change their business model so there's a better chance to make money even if everyone is wrong about the squeeze. That said, I think the squeeze is real, I don't think the squeeze has squozen, and once I went all in on GME, I stopped watching AMC news.

IMPORTANT! There is no ‚Äúofficial FINRA‚Äù short report

Huge misconception I‚Äôm seeing is that the information that you see on FINRA-markets.Morningstar.com is an ‚Äúofficial FINRA‚Äù short report. It‚Äôs not. It‚Äôs just FINRA‚Äôs link to Morningstar which doesn‚Äôt always have accurate data. The info is NOT official and does NOT come from FINRA. 
Why is this important? Morningstar has the wrong float on 2 stocks you may have heard of- AMC and GME. They have the GME float as 27M shares (??) it‚Äôs 54M. They have AMC float as 285M it‚Äôs 400M. 

Most websites have stale float for AMC because they issued a ton of shares in Jan and they‚Äôre not accounting for Silver Lake conversion. Morningstar doesn‚Äôt include any insider or company that owns more than 10% of share in the float calc which is just...wrong? Fido‚Äôs shares def should have been in float. For example look at MarketWatch. They have the float as 54M. A lot of confusion about ‚Äúwhat is the real short interest‚Äù doesn‚Äôt stem from ‚Äúwhat are the total shares short‚Äù it stems from ‚Äúwhat is the float?‚Äù

**TL; DR** FINRA does NOT have an official short interest report. NYSE and NASDAQ separately report SI. NASDAQ is available to public online. NYSE is available for a fee. Info on that page is from a 3rd party provider- Morningstar, which isn‚Äôt 100% accurate. Bloomberg gets the SI from the exchanges and people can already see it. You don‚Äôt have to wait haha. 

(Also- I don‚Äôt think it even matters! If enough people think the stock has high short interest it will trade that way. Last SI report saw GME short decline again and that day the stock started its second moon)

gqdw83y;Legend_Of_Herky;1;I don't think he's targeting newbies, just stressing his concern at the abnormal amount of investors that have no idea what a non-covid market looks like, whether that's their fault or not.  There's a large number of newer investors that are 100% invested into one company/sector. Investors are seeing outsized returns in relatively short time frames and thinking that it's normal.  I like to think most people, (some are definitely jealous of returns), are concerned that these investors will give everything back if we see an prolonged market downturn.  The true tragedy that we've already seen play out a bit with the GME/AMC, etc. story is that there are investors that got burned and think the entire system is rigged and will not invest again, seriously hampering their ability to grow wealth/retire.;stocks;2021-03-09 23:09:22

But i think most people would agree that  the theater experience is much better than watching from home, but I‚Äôm not convinced theaters can maintain their ticket sales over time. So maybe they find alternative uses for their space. 

As far as alternative uses for those screens and seats, I think that‚Äôs an interesting point. Not sure if I could see gaming moving in, but yeah, there is some flexibility. Could online university extensions provide classes in an AMC theater? Maybe.

gqduoha;jehedjchrie;1;Yup always remember the greater the risk the greater the potential reward. If you bought $40 AMC calls with expiration of 3/19/21 and another with expiration of 3/19/23, the shorter expiration is obviously much less likely to hit the strike, given it expires 2 years prior to the 2023 call. Given this you can see why on average the closer to expiration, and the closer to being in the money an option is, the more profitable it‚Äôll be given an increase in the underlying stock price.

gqdprlw;Eminence120;2;"The issue with it being like 2008 is that  a security that was essentially valueless low rated mortgages at risk of failure were propped up by a massive betting scheme that created one of the largest bubbles we have ever seen. Almost everyone in the financial industry was long these mortgage backed securities and as we know not many people shorted them. I don't feel that short squeezes in either gme or amc or whatever meme stock as affecting the market for too long. Sure, some of these hedges will have to sell some of their value based securities to cover their short position. This may cause a general market sell off and a major correction. But the recovery from this correction would be quick as there are PLENTY of buyers with dry powder waiting to jump on those value stocks. Look at what happened with TSLA and other growth plays today. It is clear that many were waiting for a moment to pounce. If TSLA was essentially valueless then yes that would cause a general market crash as so many institutions are long TSLA. But they aren't so it won't happen that way.

gqdobap;sirrahtap;1;"I'm not savvy enough for price targets, but my thought isn't that AMC will go back to what it was in february 2020, right before the pandemic.  I think it'll go back the prices from years before that....maybe mid $20s?  But like I said, I haven't done any research to look for specific price targets, so maybe its only mid teens, maybe its above $20s

My thought is that management will have to (and probably already has started) drastically change their business in order to make a decent recovery.  Trim fat, and really work at making money.  And at the same time, I think there will be a huge surge in ticket sales.  They were dropping off pre-pandemic, but people still did like going to the movies.  Now that we've had a year+ of no movies, people might feel like they've been taking them for granted, so they'll make up for lost time and then some (I think the same thing will happen with concerts/sports/etc)

gqdl4sl;barelyrolling42069v2;1;You buy the option to purchase 100 shares of a stock at your strike price. That doesn't matter though, most retards here just buy it and then try to sell it back to someone else once the stock crawls up and the premium goes up with it.I would say that probably about 95% of the people on here have never even or don't even know how to exercise a call option. so if I were you, I would just go ahead and buy a call option. You basically spend a certain amount of money which would be considered this call options extrinsic value, and then you hope that the extrinsic value increases so then you could sell it. What you have to worry about is theta decay which is the extrinsic value of the call option reducing over time as well as intrinsic value which means the stocks overall price going down. But honestly, if I were you, I would choose a somewhat cheap stock like BB or AMC, and then buy a call or put option and then see where it goes.

I think a lot of people viewed it as a ""budget"" GME stock, so I am guessing that people made similar types of calls on it as they did on GME. I could be wrong on that.

As far as actual value, there is inherent value to the movie theater experience, but the release of new movies to services like HBO Max and Disney+ will cut into their monopoly on seeing new releases.

Releasing new movies directly to premium streaming services will cut into movie theaters, but there are also growth opportunities that theaters can try to take advantage of once pandemic restrictions start lifting after vaccine distribution.

As for why the two stocks are both going up along similar trends, I think this GME spike is due to calls that were written OTM coming close to ITM and MMs needing to cover to stay delta neutral. Similar calls were probably written for AMC, and so it is also experiencing a gamma squeeze, but on a smaller scale.";wallstreetbets;2021-03-09 20:56:49

gqcz1zy;ehennis;1;"I did the same thing with AMC. Averaged my cost down from $10 to $7. But, ""I'll sell if it starts going lower"" is a ton easier said than done. You are getting high premiums from volatility. If GME drops back to $200 on Friday you have to decide where you put your next strike. If you stay at $300 and the stock falls to $100 you are bag holding with no way out for the week. If you choose $200 for the high premium and it goes up you lost money. Then, what is your decision? You won't get much at $300c. But, you go lower and it could get assigned and you still lose money on the stock and have cap gains on the option premium.

With all this said, I fully believe in covered calls and being on the sell side. I just don't like buying up here because I have lost my ass multiple times.";wallstreetbets;2021-03-09 18:58:01

gqcr657;weavin;31;"Hi guys,
Just another tale of blind stupidity to cheer you all up.


I am an investing noob, though I have dabbled in a few investments, my best so far was buying shares in Greggs  (a UK cold pastry/sausage roll takeaway shop) days before they launched their vegan sausage roll which saw shares jump by 30% and Just Eat (a UK deliveroo service) after they tanked to their lowest share price in years following much bad press regarding fraudulent food hygiene ratings. In an industry magazine I read and was impressed by their plans to improve their public image and hopped aboard - when I sold I saw a 133% return. Both were just lucky punts really, though knowing the industry probably helped.


Like a complete FOMOing cronut though I decided to fire up my Freetrade account again and bought 3 shares of GME near the current peak at around $330 and a load of AMC near it's peak of $14. Yes like I have stated I am barely sentient and it's a miracle I even managed to figure out how to redownload the app.


Despite spending more than I should have though, I held on tight like an autistic limpet and bought another 3 shares at $52 to average down my position. 


I'd like to thank you all for coming back for me today as my portfolio is currently up 9% despite staring at losses of $1300 for weeks literally hours after I first bought in.
Unless AMC one day hits $100+ I don't expect I'll be seeing life-changing amounts of money any time soon like some of you crazy eejits, but you've given me the bug to start learning more and I've had a lot of fun testing the fragile limits of my minuscule amoeba like mind.";wallstreetbets;2021-03-09 17:56:31

So then I set up a Robinhood account and was going to buy AMC. But they kept giving me errors when I tried to buy.

gqcma3h;happyhour79;1;"I agree with you.  Reddit has been overrun with people looking to make a fortune with no work not realizing that GME was a lot of work.  Also, they think everything is a short squeeze.  It's crazy.  Here's the things I'm in.  I'm not a daytrader, I'm invested in my 401k and IRA, that I let a professional do.  This is what I put money in because it's things I like, and know something about. 

1.  AMC- I was getting in before the squeeze.  This is a 30 stock when there is no madness around it. Heck with a squeeze the sky is the limit.  I just wish I got in at 5 bucks before the rise in January, but instead I was chasing pennies.  
2. HYLN-  Down significantly on this right now.  I need to average down.  This is an EV play.  Got a great battery tech that's proprietary.  They are the only EV Powertrain supplier for semis that I can find with a good product.  I need to average down, but I think it's a 22 to 26 stock.  Maybe more depending on how much Biden pushes EVs.  
3. IMAX-  Just got in this today.  It was getting hammered yesterday.  This is a bit of a gamble.  But one I think is safe.  I am going to buy the dips on this one when I see them.  I think it explodes with all the other theater stocks in the summer/3rd quarter.  There is a lot of pent up demand for theaters and returning to normalcy.  
4. Disney-  It's Disney.  

As always, I'm not a financial advisor.  I work in the work truck industry and I love entertainment, so that's what I invest in.  I stick to what I know and enjoy.";StockMarket;2021-03-09 17:21:02

What is important is what they look like moving forward:

* How much cash they raised and the CEO's sentiment that they will not need to raise more through issuing more shares (dilution).
* How much go forward expense has been reduced through lease re-negotiations and other expense reduction initiatives.
* How many of their theatres are now open and when they expect to open the rest.  I believe it's 90% in the U.S. right now.
* Sentiment on pent up demand and the impact of all the movies that Hollywood has been holding to release post-covid.
* How they have adjusted their model to be more productive and efficient.

These things will give us a good feel for the long term, regardless of the good momentum and possible squeeze in the short term.

Unfortunately, I had to wait for cash to settle for two days, so I had to buy at $220 instead of $130. Still, the average is in the $160's and the squeeze potential is still on!

AMC, however, will grow more and more come May - July with or without a squeeze. I'm sure GME will as well now that Ryan Cohen is really taking charge and making things happen, but I don't know how long that will be and I don't know of its actual potential in terms of value.

gqbrtdt;ogp1;1;"ETF‚Äôs are definitely a lot less sexy than making huge returns on tech stocks and others, and I‚Äôll admit this did influence my strategy.

I‚Äôm still up on some of those riskier ‚Äúreddit stocks‚Äù like AMC and GME, and thought that I‚Äôd average my way down on some of the others. I genuinely feel that those industries and companies have good futures ahead of them.

From here, I think I‚Äôll get out of AMC and focus on putting a larger portion towards those indexes while still taking some of those good opportunities.

gqbqwzf;Tristamwolf;1;AMC already has one major catalyst with the massive reduction in debt they've already shown and could easily see increased attendance post-COVID as people seek out activities they used to love again, not to mention their budding streaming platform and  the fact that AMC has a near identical squeeze setup to GME presently at a much more reasonable price (still under half the levels they had before they started taking on debt in order to expand a few years back).  Meanwhile GME's best bet right now is to emulate CHEWY's success in an industry with a smaller market share, no regular subscription type purchases needed, and more viable and regularly used competition from sites like Amazon.  I think GME can reinvent itself, but no way do I see it as worth 3 times what Chewy (literally the same model but better) unless it has a squeeze happen.  Now, I think there may still be more squeeze holding out in GME, but if you're ignoring AMC you're making a mistake;stocks;2021-03-09 13:42:22

If I was you, i would look at stocks that have a very steady value. ie, their beta is close to 1. That way, you're not just gambling. Cause right now, I'd say that you should put your money in ETFs and only invest in stocks with dividends because if you aren't researching the shit out of any companies, then you're pretty much gambling.   


For the most part, Cannabis companies may grow, but look at any company and their finances are garbage. I can't find one company that has good finances that is in the weed business.

gqbncut;SoggyEntertainment79;1;"4:30 am west coast time. Dow up .5%, s&amp;p500 up 1%, and Nasdaq up 2.2%. I have 8 different dashboards -  covering on average 8 to 12 stocks, most individual, some ETF's. All are up with a few averaging over 5% increase based upon pre-market activity. Will it hold up for the trading day? Doubtful. Be flexible is my mantra. When options trades go sideways better imo to take the loss and redeploy available capital. To hope against hope that a bad position will miraculously turn around is vain.  Accept the mistake and sell it before it expires worthless. 

Sometimes it is better to simply believe what the market tells us than to fight it or try to prove that it is wrong. If an increase in bond yield triggers a sell off in big tech why fight it? Rather try to understand why this is so. 

Do your homework. Do you know what stocks are in the various ARK funds? What about QQQ or DDM? Do you know the market capitalization of the various stocks you own? Do you know the difference between value, growth and speculative stocks? Did you know that the Nasdaq and the Djia are diverging by the largest amount since the late '90s?

If you follow a Reddior who always throws out a disclaimer: ""don't listen to anything I say. I dont know what I am talking about"" yadda yadda. Be aware - imo - that such folks are the worst sort of demagogues that exist?

Did you make money on gme or amc or bb etc. Do your homework. Don't follow the advice of the demagogues. They are worse than the suits and the hedge fund guys.";investing;2021-03-09 13:08:09

gqbmyv1;Life-Cricket1898;1;"So

I don't have anything in RKT

I did however predict this first squeeze right, and pulled out my accounts almost at the top, leveraging more Tendies, going all in GME/ AMC.

What I would say is pull up a three month overview of RKT, and sundial and observe. Then pull up GME and AMC and tell me if you see any familiar patterns (And what is a rough time frame between squeezes), As of now RKT is following a second squeeze trend. I'm not a fortune teller, though considering the 5% dividend coming up I'm sure it has a better then decent shot. Only time will tell as the chart matures, hopefully it won't devolve into a dead cat bounce...

This is if you want to hold it for the long term. As for me I know no one's going to hold much longer (fomo) considering we're in the stages of GME short squeeze (I believe we're leaving the gamma phase). GME is beyond ""UNIQUE"", we may have a chance of breaking the pattern if it continues to go up past the 19th it will (should) go into the 100k realm if so (yea crazy I know). In my position I'm watching this like a hawk non- stop for a lot of people (placed their accounts all in). If I'm doing this perhaps we can use a little common sense and figure out the odds/ avs of how many people have x amount of $$$ in these positions... You can get that number from looking at the WSB user's added in the last months (throw common sense out the window of what this stock should be valued at).

I'm planning on leveraging either way from one squeeze to another and it's good if RKT takes a few weeks to mature sideways. It'll take that long for GME unique squeeze to go through anyway... This is my perspective of the moment and the forecast always... ALWAYS CHANGES. 

                               -Not finical advice-

As for me I like the stock, and wish you the best of luck.

Regarding long-term fundamental analysis: there will be some changes post-pandemic. All studios are shrinking their window between theater release and streaming/DVD release, so that it's only 1 to 1.5 months (and Warner Bros. plans to do both at once). I was listening to a podcast interview with a Hollywood attorney/former editor of The Hollywood Reporter--he says he thinks the theater business will become more ""botique,"" so that fewer survive, but those that do provide better service. Don't know enough about AMC to determine whether it would be on that list, but I agree it's not a good long-term investment.";stocks;2021-03-08 23:58:03

gq9ivoo;dell_arness2;15;"Emphasis on cash accounts. Here's a Robinhood [example.](https://robinhood.com/us/en/support/articles/robinhood-accounts/) Here's a good reference on what PDT means: https://www.finra.org/investors/learn-to-invest/advanced-investing/day-trading-margin-requirements-know-rules

&gt;any *margin customer* that day trades (buys then sells or sells short then buys the same security on the same day) four or more times in five business days, provided the number of day trades are more than six percent of the customer's total trading activity for that same five-day period. Under the rules, a pattern day trader must maintain minimum equity of $25,000 on any day that the customer day trades.

HOWEVER, cash accounts are subject to other restrictions. For example, you can't sell short in a cash account (as doing so necessitates borrowing shares, and borrowing isn't allowed). You also need to be careful that you don't violate [Regulation T](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/CFR-2018-title12-vol3/xml/CFR-2018-title12-vol3-sec220-8.xml). This means that you need to pay attention to [settlement dates](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/settlementdate.asp) where money is untouchable (if you sell shares of AMC today, you cannot spend or withdraw that money until two days after the sale).

""whatever you want"" probably wasn't the best way to put it. It is possible to day-trade without having $25k but there's a lot more red-tape.";wallstreetbets;2021-03-08 22:33:54

Did you have a problem with ARK and others creating bubbles in the hype stocks? Tesla valuation had nothing to do with reality, yet no-one was saying long side should be restricted.
If you were to restrict something, it would make sense to restrict both longs bubbles and short manipulation.

Could end up great or I lose my premium. Wouldn‚Äôt be the end of the world by any means but obviously not the plan I set forward with this buy.

its the first big blockbuster ppl want to see after 1 fking year

godzilla you want to watch in a cinema

with all the other cinemas dying cuz of covid means less competition also

ppl like me are starving for a big screen experience, i can only imagine how this will look on paper

ppl want in but only 25% volume, meaning it should stretch the time where they are officially full

say normally the first 1-2 weeks the movie is full, with this they could maybe have a full month each weekend where every room is filled to its max ( 25%)

&amp;#x200B;

officially that will sound pretty fking good i WOULD think

i honestly do think amc might make a big boy jump if everything keeps going

&amp;#x200B;

also remember alot of ppl can only go once, and godzilla will be that once with the family, so right now they wont go to the movies, theyll wait 

then later mortal kombat will release like what 5 days later or so

2 different audiences, ill hold this shit at least until godzilla  releases

All of the money I'm playing GME with is AMC profit so I have no skin in the game but it's definitely intriguing. 


Correct me if I'm wrong but the short data we have is all out of date and reflects closed positions just following the original squeeze. If shorts piled back in after the hype died down, we could have significant SI that's simply not reflected in the reported data because that report lags *by weeks.* If GME continues to climb then $300 would just be a stepping stone really, as shorts would be in a real shitpickle.";wallstreetbets;2021-03-08 18:04:45

I just don't know how AMC can turn things around. They can show reruns of older movies and maybe make concession profit margins better, but that's about it. No hate, just curious as to what you see.;wallstreetbets;2021-03-08 17:33:10

They have launched a streaming service, but won't really know the full effect of that until some time down the road.  I honestly believe Hollywood wants the box offices open, really helps pay off their production costs.

I would suggest either finding a very cheap call/put option to buy just to see how it moves from hour to hour (or minute to minute) or start with paper trading so you don't burn your own money.

A gamma squeeze happens when a lot of calls close in the money. It is more rare, but has a lot higher potential. Once at end of close on Fri, then all the MM will be forced to buy AMC to cover the call options. 

Same idea, but different ppl buying to cover there ass. Also gamma squeezes tend to be rarer because most traders close out their contracts before expiry anyways.";wallstreetbets;2021-03-08 16:15:35

From the time that the DD started rolling in, and you believed you were on to something big, not just some gains, but when you sat back and were like, WTF are we holding, what time frame did you see. I am looking at many stocks that have seen a big squeeze in the last 24 months, and while yes, GME got the attention it was not the only one. I am trying to see from really the moment the stock went from like up and down .50c to up and down 1.00 to then it soared like 20, 30, 50 etc. what time frame was that. I would like to hear from someone who was in before really any of this started and or just some fellow apes with some info. Cheers.

Hollywood is *clearly* saving all their blockbusters for the theaters because that‚Äôs where they make the most money - example: James Bond has been in the queue waiting and getting pushed back amongst many others specifically for theatrical release to make that opening weekend guap.

We saw WW84 just shit itself. At the theater, they would have at least made a killing one that first weekend before people realized it stunk.  Instead, they tanked on streaming.

**Hollywood can Hold movies just like we can hold GME priming them to boom.**  Eventually, AMC goes back up to $20, $25, possibly higher especially if they rebrand and make some changes to their business model.

-ZOM: Crazy institutional backing, has a lot of patent catalyst for good growth

-NGAC: EV Last Mile trucks.  Already has Amazon and UPS vans spotted by some sneaky redditors in California!

-AMC: Because who doesn't watch movies? Earnings report this week too

-ALUS: Norwegian government backed battery maker.  Heavily invested in by European whale institutions

-PRPL: Currently sitting at 30, but was able to hit 32 on Friday.  Should bounce back to ATLEAST 34-35 this week.  I'm very bullish on this one!
