gr8vdl9;oksono;1;"&gt;No, the share price times the share count (portfolio value) is what matters from a practical perspective. Doesn't matter if your portfolio is 20 shares @ 1 usd and 10 shares @ 2 usd. If you think share count is what matters I'll gladly trade you 100 GE for 100 AAPL.

Ok that's not what I meant, and I think you know that. It feels like you're now talking down to me.

I'm saying whether or not you had 100 shares of apple month 1 at $1,000/share and the next month you had 100 shares of apples month 2 at $800/share because of market volatility, that doesn't matter. What matters if you have 100 shares of apples and you can reliably predict your dividend. If you need $100 and the dividend is $1/share you get $100 in either case.

That contrasts with a stock sale withdrawal where because of volatility in month 3 you may not have the $100 you need - unless you raise your withdrawal rate - because your physical shares have permanently decreased. 

You will still have your $100 dividend had you not sold stock.";financialindependence;2021-03-17 15:30:31

gr8abl5;Kalsin8;1;"Covered calls cap your gains while still exposing you to the same downside risk. The premium is also dependent on how volatile the stock price is, if the stock is **too** stable, then the premium is also going to be really low. Using your AAPL example, let's say you buy 100 shares for $125 and sell a 3/26 130C for $0.94:

1. If the price of AAPL shoots up to $150 at expiration, you're forced to sell at $130, giving up an additional $20/share = $2000.

2. If the price of AAPL drops to $105, you keep the $94 premium, but you lose $20/share = $2000. The +$94 is going to seem like nothing next to the -$2000.

3. Realistically, you're looking at a 10-20% return/year selling options, which sounds pretty nice but you also have to actively manage it. Some ETFs can return that much or more, and all you have to do is buy and hold and check it once a month.

4. It doesn't really give you much protection if the market goes against you, just a band-aid at most. While there's stories of people who turned a losing position into profit by selling CC's, it also ties up a lot of capital in a losing position rather than cutting losses and deploying elsewhere for potentially bigger gains in a shorter amount of time.

CC's work best in a sideways market or one that's slowly going up at a predictable rate, but not so well when things are volatile or dropping.";stocks;2021-03-17 12:26:57

gr7t87k;darkMatterMatterz;1;"This is where I disagree. This might be my strong AAPL bias speaking as I‚Äôm holding good chunk of their shares. 

Apple just exited from negative echo chamber in regards their laptops. They fixed the hardware issues (notably the keyboard), there‚Äôs rumours that ports are coming back (due to high demand from the power users). Due to their integrated ecosystem they were first ones to pull off ARM architecture and actually exponentially improve the performance and battery life without even needing a fan, and this is just a beginning. Look up YouTube channels and there are PC users making videos on why should people switch to Apple products. They are about to dominate the market like no one ever done before. Here the thing. Once you purchase iPhone AND a computer, consider yourself locked into their ecosystem, meaning the cycle will be going on for at least a decade.

Ad revenue: look how they are fencing off social media platforms from collecting excessive amount information for advertising purposes. Does apple really care about the privacy? Maybe, but they are not doing for the sake of privacy. My pure speculation is that in coming years, social media will have to go through apple to access hashed information so that they can send personalised advertisements via apple to their users. And guess what, Apple won‚Äôt be giving away they user hashes for free. 

Plus we have speculations of Apple tipping their toes into cars, VR (possibly gaming as well?) etc.";stocks;2021-03-17 08:04:10

gr6yriv;Qs9bxNKZ;1;"It's not just ""how much is it valued at"" but ""compared to what?""

When you look at any individual stock, you should look at the position that stock has in the overall market (as as a retailer such as AAPL compared to Samsung).  

* How is the market position?
* What is the strength of the currency by which you'll be buying the stock?
* How does the overall market look?

It's a comparison, what your dollar can buy you versus the number of shares that AAPL you can acquire.  Look at your other stocks, and compare them that way - by ratios.  Look at the AAPL stock and compare it to the overall market.  Those give you two barometers that are price independent.  

1 AAPL or 1 WMT?  Now what if it were 10 AAPL for 1 WMT?  

1 AAPL or 1 VTI?  Again, what if it were 10 VTI for one share of AAPL?

Berkshire looks expensive now, but since there hasn't been a split ... same can be said about TSLA, but there has been a split (and it's still over $600/sh)

My AAPL position this past year is up to a bit over $50K, with an average buy-in price of $68.  I use WMT above) because my buy-in price there was $113, so two of WMT for one of AAPL back in 2020?

Buy an ATM call, and sell the $5 OTM call. **As long as the stock price is above the call you sold by expiry, you double your money** or better. Best part is there's no exposure to theta/decay.

Example:

Buy AAPL Jan22 $122.5, Sell AAPL Jan22 $127.5

Cost is $2.25 per contract. If AAPL closes above $127.5 on the Jan19 2022 you get 125% ROI (Sell for $5). Though you probably want to sell for $4.80 so you can close out early.

You could do this for any expiry (next week, next month) and it would be the same.

For instance, I bought to open a put contract on AAPL with a 110 strike, when it doesn't hit 110, it expires and I'm just out the premium.

I also sold to open a put position in FUBO with a 28.5 strike. When I did this, I was credited the premium of the contract, but I'm on the hook to buy 100 shares at 28.5 if the price goes below that. If it doesn't go below that, then I will simply keep the premium and move on. 

Keep in mind this still isn't infinite loss even in the worst case.

The real danger is selling to open a call option for which you are short the shares needed to cover the position. In that case, if the price goes to infinity, you will need to buy 100 shares at whatever price to fulfill the contract obligation, which is infinite loss.";stocks;2021-03-16 23:22:32

Buffet is Buffet. It would be great if we could all gobble up companies and make big moves like him. He's very wise and also came from a booming generation that was much different than todays economy.

I get the example you used, its used often in explaining dividend vs non-dividend. My point though, from the original argument is it's too simplistic, and taxes is often what is used to argue the cons of dividends. That you can sell shares and you only get taxed on the gains, rather than taxed on 100% of the dividend.

What I was trying to get at is if this is an investment portfolio you're building for retirement and you chose a stock for growth and no dividends, its likely your average cost is low as you held it for years. Using AAPL and (forget the dividend for now) accounting for splits, the cost per share on Jan 1, 2010 would be around $7.50. Now if you sold today (round to 125.00 a share), you would be taxed long terms capital gains on 117.50 per share, but you are reducing your portfolio every time you sell. It's the part of chipping away at what generates income is the part I am trying to highlight. If you built up enough for the dividends to generate income you are taxed long term capital gains on 100% of the income but you are not reducing your portfolio every time you sell. 

Also I don't encourage people to be 100% of all their investments into dividends, I don't think they're bad long term and in most cases people end up taking dividends anyways because most people buy ETFs / Mutual Funds or some other kind of % generating income.";stocks;2021-03-16 23:07:44

Either way, I believe that we are at an inflection point with birth rates. On a macro-level, economic output is heavily coupled with the birth rate, as is the education level of women. We are now in a place with high unemployment among both sexes and high education rates among women = less and less babies are going to be born. No post-COVID orgies are gonna change that.

gr5f0t1;astheworldspins;1;"&gt; Nice strawman. I think you need to read Buffett‚Äôs 2012 letter to shareholders.

Your argument is that dividends create some kind of decay over time. They just don't. 

&gt; Companies like TSLA have reinvestment opportunities compared to the boring blue chip companies. If TSLA didn‚Äôt know what to do with the extra cash, then share buybacks or a dividend would be needed. I don‚Äôt quite understand what you‚Äôre getting at in this part.

You're assuming everyone wants to dump all their money into volatile stocks. In a bull market - they rock. When the bears come, your portfolio loses half its value (granted this is just unrealized value).

&gt; If you bought BRK, you would‚Äôve never paid taxes until you sold the stock. If you bought a bunch of dividend stocks you‚Äôd be paying taxes on all the dividends + when you sold the stock.

If you're generating revenue from your stocks you would need to sell in order to take money and reallocate or to use as income. You would be taxed then. If you don't need to sell your position to generate revenue, I don't see the argument here that buy and hold is the only solution. I have both. I have some that are growth and some that are dividend only and my goal is to generate monthly revenue so I can live off the income from this, and part of that is through dividends.

&gt; Well investing in only dividend stocks for the dividends compared to buying the index for the appreciation is quite different.

Again, you're assuming stocks that pay a dividend never appreciate. My years of holding MSFT and AAPL will beg to differ.

&gt; I don‚Äôt know if you‚Äôre a student or what, but the qualified dividend taxes start at $40k a year income. That‚Äôs not a high tax bracket, the median American is already in that tax bracket. Plus you don‚Äôt think a 15% will hurt your gains over the long term??

I am staring down retirement dude and have been investing for decades. Before I left my company as a C exec I was in a high tax bracket. I would gladly pay 15% in taxes instead of 30+ I had been paying before. You're going to get taxed no matter what. Taking capital gains and dividends taxes are less than what you pay taking a salary. This argument you're getting fucked by paying taxes is ridiculous. I am talking specifically non retirement funds as I can't put everything into those.";stocks;2021-03-16 18:25:26

gr4mbto;astheworldspins;1;"In a simple theory it works like this, but you will find in the markets stocks that pay a dividend aren't flat and often recover the difference and they're more closely pegged to market sentiment (and note, when I think dividend stocks I don't mean stocks that pay absurd dividends and are destined to go bankrupt, I mean stocks like AT&amp;T, VZ, MSFT, AAPL). If the idea that the dividend eroded value from the principle over time then my stocks, like the REITs, would be a fraction of what they were when I bought. In reality, they're all up.

The blue chips that pay decent dividends - like 3-7% are not growth stocks so I wouldn't expect 100% gains from them yoy, but growth stocks don't generally pay dividends either and growth stocks can lose value quickly (TSLA e.g.). Those blue chip dividend stocks are boring and slow, but they don't drop 50% in value over some random tweet in the middle of the night neither.

The COST example is due to the special dividend they offer every few years and if you zoom out you will see COST grew around 30% in 6 months, along with a lot of the market. If you bought COST in 2018, you'd be up about 100% when that special dividend was announced as well as getting 7 dividends and 1 special dividend.

People keep talking about index funds instead, but etfs also invest in dividend stocks and pay dividends. So I don't quite see the argument in favor if just looking at it from the dividend perspective, not to mention the etf fees. The only benefit is less exposure to individual stocks. They are a great way to invest if you don't want to take the time to manage your own stock portfolio.

Taxes. I mean you're paying taxes on your income and unless you're in some high tax bracket, the tax rate is like 15% on qualified dividends. I'd rather pay 15% on money that was invested. I don't get the big argument about taxes and dividends.";stocks;2021-03-16 14:52:58

gr4ht68;all-day-every-day;7;"If you guys need help to remain calm here is my previous comment. This dip is artificial.

https://www.tradingview.com/chart/?symbol=NYSE%3AGME

Open up trading view and play with the charts a bit.

Click on f(x) indicator and then enable some of the built in ones.

Best DD is the ones you do yourself and see with your own eyes. Use the DD to help guide you.

If you want to see the OBV (On-balance Volume) that some of DD here has been talking about you can compare GME OBV to another ticker like TSLA of AAPL.

You will see some something interesting.

Edit: Back on my computer now.

GME - On-balance Volume

https://www.tradingview.com/x/9yLEeJ3Y/

AMC - On-balance Volume

https://www.tradingview.com/x/3pHrcxuC/

APHA - On-balance Volume

https://www.tradingview.com/x/4WxQP15t/

RKT - On-balance Volume

https://www.tradingview.com/x/e4ImTO5F/

BB - On-balance Volume

https://www.tradingview.com/x/hJ7n0wHg/

TSLA - On-balance Volume

https://www.tradingview.com/x/B3sH3OEi/

Notice the difference?

Price dropping on GME doesn't flow volume flow.

$GME is an anomaly. Even compared to $RKT $AMC $ANAL

From what I researched I reached the conclusion that with financial corporations and mainstream investors getting involved this time around, and learning about short squeezes and gamma squeezes I got in. I had immediate results, which was very gratifying for a change. To make a long story short I was up over 120% in two weeks. I have seen it go up and down since,  but I find it a lot less stressful when the change does not touch my original investment. Even after the terrible day yesterday I am still up 41%.

I'm still losing some money by holding the LEAPs and shares and not selling and buying them lower but it makes me lose quite a bit less money, but yeah, my portfolio will have like 140 shares, 3 Jan '22 and Jan '23 calls, a Jan '23 covered call (short, delta negative), and maybe 3-4 Mar 26 123.00 puts (delta negative), kind of a mess of stuff, but offsets the losses on all the delta positive stuff I'm holding.

gr3ck6l;Bcron;1;"Apple isn't offering guidance during Coronavirus [but February looks to be an absolute knockout month for phone sales in China](http://www.caict.ac.cn/kxyj/qwfb/qwsj/202103/P020210311328926953317.pdf), predominantly 5G, with &gt;10% from non-domestic brands (mainly Apple) so I'm hoping I caught this before quants did.  Top that off with Apple discontinuing a handful of products, that one home speaker and a Macbook or two, and their proclivity for having events in March that showcase new products (halfway between their September events).  I mean, they're cutting products so I'm hoping they unveil new ones at an event, seems a little more likely than not.  Applecar rumors (probably not as fruitful), lots of potential things to make this pop, on top of the fact that they had an amazing quarter with &gt;100bn in revenue in that quarter, trading some 20% under highs due to interest rates, despite having damn near 100 billion cash on hand (they're poised to be the one tech stock that doesn't give a fuck about issuing corporate debt).  They still have the ability to do share buybacks, billions worth, and that's another catalyst if it hits the news.  Forward P/E under 30, P/S around 6, it trades at 'value stock' multiples despite being a growth tech stock, and if tech runs, I'm pretty sure this would run harder in a teetering interest rate environment on that basis.

Problem with AAPL is that institutional traders ignore it - they don't offer guidance and their projects are so secretive that even people who are working on projects have little idea of the project as a whole.  No rumors no leaks etc.  Apple is not apt to throw out actual numbers for sales and whatnot, on top of not giving guidelines for super secret projects, so it's hard for people to actually determine a value on the company in light of changing dynamics.  

Trading is in essense trying to profit on inefficiencies in the market, and it's literally impossible to do that with Apple since so little is known about what they're working on, so it sits around like a turd because only investors throw money into it, kinda like that, but the price and the potential catalysts make it appealing, and if I'm wrong, the fundamentals at least make it a reasonable company to sit in.";wallstreetbets;2021-03-16 05:01:55

VTI 25%

gr29ezi;mn_my;1;"Assuming tax rules make owning ETFs the worst investment possible, how would you focus a portfolio? In Ireland the last thing you want to own is an ETF. There's a 41% tax on any profits you make, losses from one ETF cannot be offset against gains from another, owning US-domiciled ETFs is currently illegal unless they provide a Key Investor Information Document, plus, every 8 years, your ETF is ""deemed disposed"" and you have to pay 41% tax on the UNrealized gains of the previous 8 years. (While you do get a tax credit for those for when you do finally dispose of the ETF, the thought of finding 41% of profits that have been compounding for a few decades is truly terrifying.)  


So that puts a pin in long-term investing with ETFs. My other option is individual shares, which are only(!) subject to a 33% tax on realized gains. But it's left me a bit confused about how to approach a long-term investing plan. I'm 26, but I have the risk tolerance of single-ply toilet paper, so time is my best asset here. My current feeling is that the best thing to do would be to build a backbone of large holding companies and companies with wide product ranges (Berkshire, Franklin Resources, Unilever, P&amp;G, PepsiCo, Yum Brands, etc.), some of the less volatile tech stalwarts like AAPL and MSFT, and then have a small portion of the portfolio dedicated to the pure chaos of ""using my best judgement"".  


My other option is to emigrate and lemme just say the UK looks a little tempting right now (I'd kill for an ISA). But let's say you hypothetically live in Ireland, making your responses 100% not financial advice.

gr1ylg5;PM_ME_CATS_420;1;"MO - they've been on a multi-year downward trend and they sell cigarettes, not exactly the best looking company at first glance. However, that downtrend is starting to break down and they give sexy, sexy dividends. The main reason Im bullish is due to vaping products and weed. Altira has a couple of patents for some cannabis vapes, hired some lobbyists from cannabis/hemp law-firms and are trying to get CBD legalized. They wouldnt be doing that unless they have big plans for the future, and as a tobacco company alot of that infrastructure must commute. The vaping thing is mainly because im in college and some of these mfs vape like a goddamn chimney; life long customers MO can depend on.

DIS- they own like, every single major entertainment property and they show no signs of slowing down. Sometimes I think that they want a monopoly on the entire entertainment industry or something lol. I dont bet against the mouse anymore, its never worked out.

AAPL- well, its fucking apple. And there are rumors that they're trying to break into AR/VR. I work in my school's virtual reality and 3D printing lab. Commercial VR tech is really cool, but so far not the most practical for home use. Setting everything up is a bit asinine, and I cant imagine the average person loading up a VR set on the regular despite the fact that everyone I know agrees that its cool as fuck. I can totally see AAPL dominating the market once they give it the Apple makeover. (more intuitive controls, simple design, more lightweight hardware requirements, easy setup etc.) Best part is, even if this rumored headset goes the way of google glasses, you're still left with a bunch of shares of apple.

KTOS- I like them and did a DD. Long story short, they have consistent and growing contracts with the US and are primed to enter the aerospace field. If it matters to you, the stock is also part of some ARK funds.

APPH- This one is highly, highly speculative and the company I have the least stake in. Theyre an AgTech company making indoor farms, mainly for tomatos but they plan on branching out. I love the sustainable business model, and as someone who uses a similar service (Im in Canada) I believe that theres a genuine need for these types of farms. However, they're a very new company and they probably wont be seeing any profits until they scale up alot more. Its also not like the tech is groundbreaking or anything, so R&amp;D barriers to entry aren't very high. I will say that as someone who grows weed and vegetables hydroponically that the equipment needed for either is almost identical. So, in the case of full legalization theres a chance they might start growing some of that cash crop to subsidize vegetable sales, something hard to make a profit on without economies of scale. Of course, this entirely depends on how legalization is gonna get rolled out or if they even decide that weed is a good bumper crop. Hence why Im not about to YOLO anything into this anytime soon, I just want some exposure. 

COP- I like making money more than I hate investing in oil. And so far this company has made me good money. Green energy may be the future, but that transition is unfortunately gonna take a couple of decades. In the meantime, we're gonna have to power the factories that make solar panels and windmills with something else, and it looks like thats gonna be oil for the time being. Plus, they also have a sexy, sexy dividend.";stocks;2021-03-15 20:44:20

Scaling into positions is one of the best things you can do instead of jumping in. ie. you want to buy 500 of AAPL, instead of doing 1 order of 500 at whatever price start with 100, watch the stock for a little to make sure it‚Äôs not going against your analysis, add another 100 when you see a good entry point, and so on until you reach your inversement amount. And same thing scale out when you reach target points you set through your analysis so you can cash in on some profits, and you can reload when you see a healthy dip.

There is no secret, just be patient.";stocks;2021-03-15 20:29:20

Bonds just don't return very much in this environment and are primarily for downside protection. If you're investing money you won't need in 10 years or more, I just think its dead money. 

AAPL, DIS are great, solid, I'd stay there. JNJ, eh, for a 19yo, the growth prospects aren't the highest. What do you see for the future of JNJ? You're young, think about companies that will be bigger than today, offer more than today. Apple used to be a computer company. Amazon used to sell books. Google was a search engine. What are the companies today that will be more than they are now? You're young, you can make a bet on a stock.

ETFs like VTI and VOO are great because you have the safety net of not doing worse than the market.

gr0klxs;HonestlyDontKnow24;1;"Scale out the price charts 5 years. You'll see that, after COVID, a lot of tech stocks (like AAPL) had huge, almost unprecedented growth. Especially when you look at the 5yr chart, you can see why so many people think it's ""overvalued."" That doesn't mean it's a bad company or won't grow in the future. It means that many think people are paying too much for it now and, eventually, it will lose a lot of its growth as it sinks back down to a regular price. Will it go back up again? A company like AAPL? Probably. But it might be better to wait until it goes down (which may even be in a year or two) and then buy in rather than buying at the top of that outrageous growth.

I got in late to the DKNG play as I was bag holding and still am RKT lol. So had to wait for more funds to transfer.

Anyways I do have some questions for you. I have sometime trouble following what you‚Äôre saying. What is RAMBO?? And FOMC? 

Also just to be sure MA is MasterCard correct lol? I know dumb question.

What‚Äôs a non-ER pump mean? 

It seems like since got said your confidence is low this week, AAPL seems like the closest to a ‚Äúsure‚Äù bet. 

I only got $1k currently to play with (hope I can rid of my RKt bags soon, specially if i can get the $1k to cover the loss).  

Out of curiosity what plays would you make if you were in a similar position?

35k a share would put the value of GME around that of AAPL. 

If volkswagen could become the world's most valuable company, I don't see any reason why GME with a way bigger short interest can't. 

A value of 100,000 a share = gme valuation of 7 trillion. 

100,000 is not a meme.

For instance if you're holding 500 shares of AAPL lets say and it's been moving sideways for 6 months (small gains here and there equaled by small losses here  and there) you can ""short"" the stock by lending out the 500 shares you own.  This is selling covered calls (a form of shorting in the near term when you think the price will not go up).  You're lending your shares to somebody who thinks the stock price will go up for a premium.  If your right and it doesn't go up, you receive a premium for lending the shares, if your wrong, you sell your shares for the predetermined price (which you should set at a price your comfortable with taking a profit at).  It's a way to earn passive income on owning a stock in a stagnant market.  Obviously the risk here is that  you're underlying stock drops significantly in price and your stuck in your option contract (i.e. you cant sell it).  That shouldn't matter too much if your long on the stock anyway.  The other risk here is that you're wrong and the stock price skyrockets and you lose out on potential gains (still doesn't matter though because you still sell at a profit).";stocks;2021-03-14 22:22:00

gqxpr8j;reaper527;1;"&gt;Also, if I choose the strike rate $50.00 does that mean I am already ITM and I am profitable the moment I buy this call?

you're ignoring the cost of the premium. if you're buying a $50 call for a $56 share, the odds are pretty good that the premium is going to be around $6/share.

on to why someone would sell a call like this, is because they think the price of the stock will go down and take the call out of the money before anyone exercises it (since TYPICALLY people will excercise at expiration).

if that $56 share drops down to $45, the $50 option is worthless (until the stock goes back above the strike). to use a more real example, look at AAPL. it was trading for 133/share in mid february. if someone sold a 1 month call with a 125 strike, they would have gotten a big premium. now, the price is around 120 a share, so that would be out of the money even though it was in the money when the option was sold, and may expire worthless.";stocks;2021-03-14 20:04:46

gqx5ayd;Awhodothey;1;"You're moving the goal post. I never suggested AAPL hasn't been a good investment in the past. Just pointed out that there are better investments. If you want to strickly focus on what should matter to an investor you would buy Microsoft because it's profits have grown faster than Apple for the past decade, twice as fast in the last four years (70% growth compared to Apple's 35%). Apple makes the majority of its profit off of products that it more or less invented, and none of these products are in markets that will sustain current profit levels. All of its major competitors have profits that have grown more in the last four years than Apple (who's profit growth has been steadily slowing) so that's a terrible argument to move the goal post to anyway. 

We're talking about the future. And AAPL is in trouble because they have traded market share for profits to get where they are, and there's no obvious path forward on this trajectory. Sharply declining growth is the most likely outcome of the next 5-10 years. AAPL has continually lost market share, and that will accelerate as people become less willing to pay premiums for increasingly negligible advancements in cell phone and laptop features.

Apple has to produce a significant innovation. If I were Apple I'd be looking at short throw projectors, smart home, and consumer multimedia product innovations. If Apple wanted to join the car manufacturer race this late in the game, it would be the nail in their coffin that would accelerate the problem they are facing over the next decade, and likely bring them to a premature failure.

gqx4lyb;wokeinthematrix;1;"I kind of feel like I might be better off investing in more stable long-term stocks, like DIS (which I believe will grow, as Disney is already huge and very likely to continue buying other companies like they bought Fox), TSLA, AAPL, 5G stocks (which will SUPPOSEDLY blow up this year or next year), etc.

But, realizing that GME could have FINALLY freed me to not only start my own life, and not only make up fir 25 years of missing out and misery, but I could live BEYOND my dreams.

I could literally have $483,000 (more or less) RIGHT NOW, which would definitely afford my healthcare next year (I turn 26 at the end of the year), I could get away from all of these right-wing extremists, I could avoid having to work away the rest of my 20s (I am so far behind the only way I can catch up otherwise is probably working another job over 40 hours a week, somehow going to school fulltime too, and likely paying for therapy more than once a month, which is all insurance will pay for) and barely even have time to sleep (which I struggle with even when I DO have time, I just can‚Äôt fall asleep early at night).

The idea of putting my stimulus and tax return (a total of over $2,300) into more secure long-term stocks definitely seems promising for years or decades down the road, but it‚Äôs depressing as f*ck, because I see myself being miserable and lonely, either overworking a terrible job, or even being homeless until I get big returns.

If I wasn‚Äôt ready to immediately move out so I could plan that better, I could at least pay my parents more rent to help them out better (they have their own debts).

I was ready to throw my stimulus and tax return into CLVS and PGEN, as these are SUPPOSEDLY the next short squeezes, but I‚Äôm not sure that will happen. And supposedly Jack in the Box and Chili‚Äôs.

I‚Äôm also planning on investing in weed stocks as the US is legalizing marijuana, I support this (although don‚Äôt personally smoke, as I take medication that would have dangerous reactions like serotonin syndrome) and think it‚Äôs safe to say that these companies will blow up, and a lot of these stocks are only like $0.30 a share right now. Also mushroom and psychedelic stocks (microdosing is already legal).

If I made all that money from GME I could afford to invest in the short-term AND long-term, AND live it up RIGHT NOW, but I can‚Äôt go back in time, so trying to find the next play.

My money is definitely not growing just sitting in a savings account though. I‚Äôm not going to take it ALL out, but I might take some extra in addition to my stimulus and tax return.

I‚Äôm 25, I don‚Äôt want to be poor and/or have to tightly budget until I‚Äôm an old man. Especially if that means I have to spend my life in either a dangerous part of a city or a small town/rural area (NEVER AGAIN!)

I just want my independence and security, and I want it now, and, at least to some extent, kind of need it before the year is over.....

I just want to enjoy the game of Life. I don‚Äôt want kids, so that‚Äôs a responsibility I won‚Äôt have, but I would like to be with women (which is easier when not poor/broke)

That‚Äôs the best I can explain it.

gqvcgge;thecheese27;1;"My degree is in data science and analytics. I have studied statistics for years and very much know what I am talking about. You have time and time again shown that you do not know how the options market operates and instead of taking a step back and reading back to yourself what you are saying and seeing how illogical it is, you choose instead to dismiss what I am saying out of pride and an overinflated ego. 

Just listen to yourself. You are so hellbent on the stock market being an exact 50/50 split and I have absolutely no reason why. If that were the case, why do you suppose hedgefunds exist? If there was no way to position yourself as the casino with a statistical edge, then how could hedgefunds maintain that very position? Obviously there exists a way to give yourself an edge. And it's selling options. 

Let me give you a trivial example so you can start processing how this works. AAPL is currently sitting at $121. You sell a CSP at $105 for 25 cents which has a 95% chance of expiring OTM and worthless and you collect that premium for free. Great, you just got a free 25 dollars. You do this 19 times and collect 25x19 = $475. Now statistically, the 20th time you do this, your put will end ITM. Okay, so let's roll your put out another week at an even lower strike price, let's say 100, which not only gives you another credit of 15 cents, but you now have an even smaller chance of the put ending ITM. You repeat this indefinitely, never have to risk your sold put being exercised and simply collect premium again and again and again. There is absolutely no possible way to lose money in this scenario. But wait, let's say you've been rolling your put and now your new strike is at 80. You go on vacation, forget about your CSP, and Apple dips to 79 when your contract expires and now you get exercised to buy 100 shares of Apple at $80. Guess what. All those weeks of rolling down your put? You were collecting premium over and over and over. So much premium that the cost basis of these shares is as low as $60, and you effectively own 100 shares of Apple, a $79 valued stock, for $60 and can do with them whatever you please.

Let's take it a step further. You now own 100 shares of Apple at a $60 cost basis. Well, Apple has been going down now for quite some time, so you decide to sell covered calls on it. With Apple sitting at $79, you sell a 85 call for 60 cents  for a week out and collect $60 in premium. Now over the next week there are three scenarios: 

1. Apple moves sideways over the next week, your call expires worthless and you get a free $60 and reduce your cost basis by 60 cents more. 

2. Apple goes up and ends above $85, you decide to let your call expire ITM, you make $100x25 plus the premium for a total of $2560. 

3. Apple continues to go down. Keep in mind your current cost basis after the premium is $59.40, so if it goes down past $59.40, then congratulations you officially have started to lose money. But wait, what if I just buy back my 85 call when Apple is at $51 for a fraction of what I sold it at and sell a new call closer to ATM for another $200 in premium? Now I made another $140 and reduced my cost basis down even further to $58 and will repeat this indefinitely as long as Apple goes down. Keep in mind the odds of Apple dropping this low are beyond lottery odds barring a complete implosion of the company.

You are just so disconnected with statistics and probability that it makes my brain physically hurt reading what you write to me. I don't know who told you every trade is a 50/50 but that is the most outlandish concept I have ever heard of in my life. If that were the case, why the fuck would anyone bother with doing any research or putting in any effort whatsoever to what they are investing in? Why not throw a fucking dart at the wall? Hate to break it to you but your professors have failed you by being as stubborn as you are. Go do some research before you make the claim that every trade is nothing more than a 50/50 and you will quickly find out how beyond absurd such a thing is to say.

Time *in* the market, beats *timing* the market. Continue your reinvestment strategy. Diversify your portfolio as you build it up. Until you build up to a 20-30k diversified portfolio, ignore red numbers. They don't exist. You've done your research and you believe in the company, right? Well, so long as you aren't seeing articles about them going insolvent, *don't sell*. 

Once your portfolio becomes thicc and juicily diversified, start looking at the red numbers. You believe in these companies, right? *Buy the dip*. That's the money. Find value, where many others don't see it. Alternatively, you could further diversify your portfolio by searching for value in the market, or if you're all green, buy more of your lowest priced holdings.

That said, *always do your DD - Due diligence.* Research every company you want to buy, in and out. Scour their balance sheets, look at institutional interest, look at insider transactions, etc. I'd bet there's tons of YouTube videos showing budding investors how to research the fundamentals of a company; how to look for value in a stock.

But, realizing that GME could have FINALLY freed me to not only start my own life, and not only make up fir 25 years of missing out and misery, but I could live BEYOND my dreams.

I could literally have $483,000 (more or less) RIGHT NOW, which would definitely afford my healthcare next year (I turn 26 at the end of the year), I could get away from all of these right-wing extremists, I could avoid having to work away the rest of my 20s (I am so far behind the only way I can catch up otherwise is probably working another job over 40 hours a week, somehow going to school fulltime too, and likely paying for therapy more than once a month, which is all insurance will pay for) and barely even have time to sleep (which I struggle with even when I DO have time, I just can‚Äôt fall asleep early at night).

The idea of putting my stimulus and tax return (a total of over $2,300) into more secure long-term stocks definitely seems promising for years or decades down the road, but it‚Äôs depressing as f*ck, because I see myself being miserable and lonely, either overworking a terrible job, or even being homeless until I get big returns.

If I wasn‚Äôt ready to immediately move out so I could plan them better, I could at least pay my parents more rent to help them out better (they have their own debts).

I was ready to throw my stimulus and tax return into CLVS, NAKD (only $1 a share!), and PGEN, as these are SUPPOSEDLY the next short squeezes, but I‚Äôm not sure that will happen.

My money is definitely not growing just sitting in a savings account though. I‚Äôm not going to take it ALL out, but I might take some extra in addition to my stimulus and tax return.

I‚Äôm 25, I don‚Äôt want to be poor and/or have to tightly budget until I‚Äôm an old man. Especially if that means I have to spend my life in either a dangerous part of a city or a small town/rural area (NEVER AGAIN!)

However, AAPL is paying a dividend now.  So, you would be missing out on that with the contracts.

This will be no easy feat and the transition will experience hiccups as is typical with a transition of this magnitude. However our confidence has never been higher, in large part due to the creation of our new team and news vision. With such diversity of thought and an eagerness to shake the status quo, better days are only ahead for Gamestop

gqr56as;NoobSniperWill;1;I sell covered calls on shares I am holding long term but still have decent IV, like AMD and AAPL. Covered calls are good additional source of income and they reduce your delta exposure, thus, reducing risk at the cost of limited upside exposure. If you have a margin account, you might be better off selling ITM puts. Since put/call parity implies long 100 shares and selling OTM calls is equivalent to sell ITM puts, and you can deploy your cash to other trade. I am also using LEAPs to create PMCC. For example, 2023 Jan SPY 300C is currently selling at $100, so you can spend $10,000 to control 100 shares that barely have any time premium with delta close to 1, and sell calls against them. SPY monthly 6% OTM calls are around $200, so in this case, you are making 200/10000 per month whereas if you hold 100 shares, you are making 200/40000, so much better return on capitals;stocks;2021-03-13 01:07:28

gqqsdud;turkeychicken;1;"There's a lot of talk about diversification lately due to the tech selloff.  While I agree that diversification is a good thing, I also believe in investing what you're familiar with. I work in tech and feel like I have a good grasp on the comings and goings of companies in the field.

In my opinion, diversification for the sake of diversification can be a bad thing if you're blindly investing in ""boomer"" stocks without actually knowing why.

As an example, these are the top 10 holdings in my portfolio based on % of account.

Symbol | Gain/Loss % | % of portfolio
-----|-----:|-----:
AMZN  |  +150.45%  |  18.05%
GOOGL | +133.97% | 12.17%
MSFT | +153.76% | 12.14%
NET | +302.07% | 5.05%
AAPL | +55.76% | 4.6%
ZG | +287.93% | 4.45%
TMO | +52.78% | 3.26%
ZTS | +31.35% | 2.93%
USAC | -4.89% | 2.39%
ABT | +58.1% | 2.26%

The top 6 are straight up tech stocks, while TMO, ZTS and ABT are in the pharma/scientific/bio sector. Of all the above investments, USAC was sort of a gamble.  I was up pre-pandemic but it's still recovering from the March 2020 crash.

A few notes on my investing style:

* I buy and hold. 

* The only time I sell is if I lose faith in the company or if the stock is a letdown (multiple percent loss) and I don't see a recovery any time soon.

* I keep about 1% of my cash available for riskier investments which I'm ok losing on if they don't pan out.

* I only set stop-losses on investments I'm starting to lose faith in or ones that were a risky purchase that aren't performing like I hoped.

**tl;dr** Invest in what you know, and if you feel like you're too holed up in one sector, do the research and make sure you know why you're investing in a company outside of your knowledge zone.";stocks;2021-03-12 23:07:26

gqqroum;cwdawg15;1;"Be careful with the term growth, in this case.

It seems like what you really mean is Large-cap and in particular, 'mega-cap.'

The problem is companies rise and fall over decades or a century. You're right. You do need to keep evaluating and looking at what is going on and know when to get out and when to stay in.

The problem is these large-caps have market power -**now**\-. They can usually safely make more money for the time being, so I definitely would not ignore them. You can own AAPL for a decade or more, while it is going great, and slowly down-size how much you own and put money into the next large-cap companies that grow over the years.

The small and mid cap companies are a combination of companies that are falling, are rising to the next big thing unknown to everyone, are rising and will never make it, and just simply won't make it.

The problem is it is a gamble to find the right ones. You can find the next big thing, but you bought 20 other companies that weren't trying to find it.

&amp;#x200B;

I usually recommend people to not forget the Russel 2000 or the S&amp;P 400, but the S&amp;P 500 has been doing better the last couple of decades.

If you invest in ETFs that track an index, always remember as companies rise and fall they are added to or removed from the indexes. So if you stay in the index funds, someone is already increasing or decreasing positions in a company as they rise and fall for you.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Growth vs. value is not about company size. It is more about the companies goals and how it operates in a market.

A growth company is investing into their product or new products. They have a clear path to growing and making more revenue in the future.

The company will have lower or no dividends. Typically, they are priced higher than the revenue they get. You will often see P/E ratios of 30 and up (price/earnings per share).

AAPL in the past decade is a good example of this. They are still investing heavily in R&amp;D and trying to make better and new products fairly rapidly over the decade. Their dividend is below 0.7% and they have a P/E ratio of 33. It could be argued that APPL is starting to mature right now.

TSLA would be a high-growth company far from maturity, that is expensive vs. revenue. There is no dividend and the P/E ratio is extremely high of $140 (12 month trailing PE $900+). There is no dividend, but rapid stock price growth.  The company is creating a new innovative product. Investors are paying a large premium for a company that is not making the revenues to justify the price.... yet. They are paying for future potential.

The stock is usually priced for the company to be larger and produce more revenue in the future.

&amp;#x200B;

A value company is a mature company that doesn't have much room to grow revenue or create new innovative products. They are still trying to cut costs, create new brands or enhancements, etc.. However, the market is saturated. It might grow slowly as there are more people in this world.

These companies usually have a dividend, which can often surpass 2% annually. The P/E ratio is usually lower, but it can get a little bit higher as the dividend increases.

One example of Coca-Cola. It is a large company. It is not in a rapid growth industry of a technology. They sell soft drinks and the market is saturated. People still buy them and there is some shifts in flavors and the world's population is growing.  They are not reinvesting much money in new products. You don't expect to see huge gains in stock price, but investors often get more dividends from the revenue they make.

There dividend is 3.3% with a P/E ratio of $23. Stock investors are not putting as much money into the stock for future growth in company size, rather they are investing for what returns they can get out it through dividends -and- slow market growth the company.

AT&amp;T is a great example. It is a technology becoming less important and there is less room for them to grow, but it is a regulated product. They own a chunk of limited airwaves and they own a system of wires to people's homes and are semi-protected from some competition.

It is expensive to maintain, but they have some pricing power over the consumer. The P/E is close to $9. You will not expect much company growth, in fact this might even be a company starting to decline and the technology of some of their products are less relevant (land-lines to homes, cable TV to homes, etc...). They are producing a 7% dividend payment to investors every year.";investing;2021-03-12 23:01:12

gqqmxv2;The_Texidian;1;"That‚Äôs a good analogy. 

I guess my thought process is like:

I see people piling into AAPL, right? AAPL‚Äôs market cap is 2.03T. That‚Äôs absolutely massive even by inflation adjusted standards. MSFT reached 583 billion in 1999 breaking the record for largest market cap, in today‚Äôs money that would be 920 billion according to the US inflation calculator. 

I‚Äôm looking at companies like V, NVDA, WMT, MA, DIS, NFLX and I see a lot more upside with them, over the 2.03T AAPL or the 1.73T MSFT. (For large cap stocks, I don‚Äôt want to talk about small or mid caps) 

Also just in my own observations, I look at the past market cap leaders, once they reach the top 5, they drop significantly or under preform until they‚Äôre out of the top 10.";stocks;2021-03-12 22:19:35

You work at the drive thru for Mickey D's and found out that the burgers are made of human meat? Priced in. You think insiders don't already know that? The market is an all powerful, all encompassing being that knows the very inner workings of your subconscious before you were even born. Your very existence was priced in decades ago when the market was valuing Standard Oil's expected future earnings based on population growth that would lead to your birth, what age you would get a car, how many times you would drive your car every week, how many times you take the bus/train, etc. Anything you can think of has already been priced in, even the things you aren't thinking of. You have no original thoughts. Your consciousness is just an illusion, a product of the omniscent market. Free will is a myth. The market sees all, knows all and will be there from the beginning of time until the end of the universe (the market has already priced in the heat death of the universe).

gqpbefh;SleepyConscience;1;"I mean, do you want the real answer or wsb answer? The nice thing about having a $500 is you can put in something stupid risky and it's not life ruining if you lose it. That said, I've spent 10 years at this point investing in stocks and the vast majority of my gains have come from going long in solid blue chip stocks like AAPL rather than speculation. For every good speculative call I make I'll screw 5 of them up. But pretty much all of my blue chip picks gain money if I just hold onto them long enough. I think diversification and index funds are overrated (at least in a bull market; I've never really participated in a long term bear market, so take what I say with a grain of salt).

gqp8b46;Viscoden;1;"The best early piece of information I gained was to think about buying a company in terms of using your own money to purchase the entire company.

It's easy to see a numbers on a screen and say ""it went up before, so I think it will again"".

It's hard to say ""no, I would not spend 600, 700 billion of my own money to purchase Tesla, because the company doesn't make enough money for me to justify that purchase"" when you see how well it has returned for shareholders in the last year. 

Investing is about risk management and facts. 

BB is currently valued at 6.29 billion, with an income of -830m (trailing twelve months). To put that in perspective, if you spent 6.3 billion dollars to buy all public shares of BB, you could then expect to lose an additional 830 million over the next 12 months. Now this is a flawed example because it is known that BB is turning around their business in a very attractive way, but it may take some time for that to catch up to make the business positive income. 

Now I do want to say that I do own a little bit of BB, but it's money that I can afford to let sit for a little while, and it's around half a percent of my active portfolio. I like the possibility of BB turning around the company and becoming a huge tech company once again.

I'd say that from my perspective it seems like you are at a point where you need to start laying the foundation for a solid portfolio. I'd recommend things like MSFT, AAPL, JPM, EBAY. I try to pay attention to P/E ratios and to buy when I think a company is at a good value. All of these companies make a TON of money, and I'd be impressed if any one of them failed within the next ten years. 

I'd caution you to reevaluate ""get rich quick"" buys, as they will statistically not work out well for you. Better to take 20% every year and turn that in to a compounding machine than to take 100% one month and lose it all over the next year. 

You won't turn your $500 back in to $2,000 in a few days, but you could retire in the future using this method. Try out the math for making a 20 or 30% annual return over 10 years. Start with something like 10k and watch what happens. And that's not even including what you could add to it over that time as well.

The market is an all powerful, all encompassing being that knows the very inner workings of your subconscious before you were even born. Your very existence was priced in decades ago when the market was valuing Standard Oil's expected future earnings based on population growth that would lead to your birth, what age you would get a car, how many times you would drive your car every week, how many times you take the bus/train, etc. Anything you can think of has already been priced in, even the things you aren't thinking of. You have no original thoughts. Your consciousness is just an illusion, a product of the omniscent market. Free will is a myth. The market sees all, knows all and will be there from the beginning of time until the end of the universe (the market has already priced in the heat death of the universe).

gqojol1;Henry1502inc;1;"I actually had a conversation with a friend yesterday. She has great credit. She could take out a $25k loan, and sell covered puts weekly on aapl or something like Gme. She would probably make $600-2000 a week doing so assuming she doesn‚Äôt get exercised. If she gets exercised on aapl no big deal since Apple will go back up and she can sell covered calls. Gme is a bit riskier. 
But assuming she can get a low enough interest rate, the loan repayment over 48 months is like $533 plus interest so she would need to make $600-650 a month to cover the loan. She‚Äôs working towards an MBA program and has a job with the local gov and has like 3 credit cards all paid off but with credit limits of like $20k.

$GOOG, I could build a financial picture that makes some of the high end street expectations appear plausible. I can also make the argument that it's overvalued based on it's own past and it's peers, but that would fail to account for the future as well as for macro economic impacts. The primary difference is forecasted EBITDA growth. $GOOG I'm looking at \~14%, $APPL I'm looking at \~5%. I could make a bull case of $2,800 in my valuation of $GOOG, I could also pretty reasonably make a bear case for $1,800 but that would likely be a stretch.

You'll grow a thicker skin and start to recognize that this happens. Make a plan for your trade and stick to it. If you plan to hold longer term, the drop is fine... it'll grow back, especially for companies like AAPL. If you're more on the speculative side it sounds like you need to use your stop losses more and better. You wouldn't have gone from +20 to -10, you would've sold at +12 and had cash ready to buy the dip. 

Its certainly hard to be bullish while watching everything drop, but if you're risk avoidant wait for a more solid signal that its slowed, then buy. Just make a plan and stick to it. If you're plan didn't include buying the dip, don't be upset that you didn't win the 'game' you never decided to play. 

As someone who prefers speculation, I'd prefer some profits now instead of maybe getting more later after its been red for a bit. If I hit ~+5% my stoploss almost never sits below my purchase price.";stocks;2021-03-12 04:31:22

gqmzcdj;DaFountain98;2;"Fair enough, it‚Äôs good that you‚Äôre aware of your limitations and personal struggles. I do the same thing and end up covering too early and lose out on potential profits from time to time. I‚Äôve done pretty well with rolling my position as opposed to snap coverage. I bought an AAPL $125 call expiring 4/1 on the 1st because I thought the dip was to be bought then. Ended up rolling down and in for a credit equal to my original investment on an AAPL $119 call expiring 3/12 and made out pretty good in the end, cleared 20% and dropped my entry to $0.

If you can teach yourself to use your aversion to losses to roll your positions or engage in credit trades instead of debit, you can make pretty decent returns.

I personally am trying to close on a house in the next 150 days, so I‚Äôve moved the vast majority of my baby portfolio into stocks to preserve the value more effectively but I still have about $500 on the side to use as collateral on spreads and shit like that.

gqmbzj2;Correct-Advisor-9363;2;Note, I am an amateur investor. I have been rebalancing my ETFs during this down time and I have noticed how much exposure to AAPL I already have. This ranges from VT, to VOO, to VOOG, to QQQ...  just about every ETF that touches AAPL (Yes, I have plenty of overlap, hence the rebalancing). I think this sell off of Apple shares was magnified by the rebalancing of so many ETFs that hold AAPL based on market cap. What would have been a small change is now magnified due to this significant ETF exposure. I noticed GOOG didn't suffer the same way. I doubt that its because it is a better company, but I think it is because at $2000 share price, many smaller investors aren't getting in to GOOG and thus it isn't prone to the same volatility.

You start to slowly sell those shares as the stock runs up until you reach back to your 100 shares.    

If the stock moves against you for too long then you need to reevaluate why you made the trade.  It might make sense to bail out.

Taking some off the table to keep aside is what you need to do if you are a trader.  Another selloff will come.  It is only a matter of time.

The top-weighted technology sector (+1.9%) is the best performer in the early going while four other groups also show gains of 1.0% or more.

Key factors driving today's performance include:

* Leadership from high-beta chipmakers. The PHLX Semiconductor Index (+3.3%) has returned into positive territory for the week thanks to gains in all 30 components. The group is now up 1.9% for the week versus a 3.2% week-to-date gain in the Nasdaq (+2.0%). *South China Morning Post* reported overnight that the U.S. and China established a working group aimed at ""easing export controls"" and ""improving supply chain security.""
* Strong showing from the largest components by weight. **Apple** (**AAPL** 122.05, +2.07, +1.7%), **Microsoft** (**MSFT** 236.54, +4.12, +1.8%), and **Visa** (**V** 226.79, +3.62, +1.6%) are all up more than 1.0%.

**Notable movers:**

* **Qorvo** (**QRVO** 175.15, +9.78, +5.9%): best performer in the sector, rallying back above its 50-day moving average (174.20).
* **ServiceNow** (**NOW** 498.88, +24.88, +5.3%): reclaiming its 200-day moving average (485.36).
* **Skyworks** (**SWKS** 174.48, +6.82, +4.1%): rising back above its 50-day moving average (171.42).
* **AMD** (**AMD** 79.96, +2.44, +3.2%): rising back above its 200-day moving average (78.77).
* **NVIDIA** (**NVDA** 515.88, +17.15, +3.4%): trading near yesterday's high.
* **PayPal** (**PYPL** 250.78, +8.71, +3.6%): rising toward its 50-day moving average (254.04).
* **Fortinet** (**FTNT** 185.41, +4.95, +2.7%): rallying to a fresh record high.
* **Broadcom** (**AVGO** 451.78, +14.19, +3.2%): rising toward its 50-day moving average (458.99).
* **Visa** (**V** 226.79, +3.62, +1.6%): rallying to a fresh record.
* **Apple** (**AAPL** 122.05, +2.07, +1.7%): rising to a one-week high.
* **Oracle** (**ORCL** 66.81, -5.31, -7.4%): weakest performer in the sector despite beating Q3 expectations, issuing above-consensus guidance for Q4, and raising its dividend.";wallstreetbets;2021-03-11 16:28:51

Personally I think you have way too many similar funds with overlap and your individual stocks are not distinct enough from the ETFs you hold. 

Very underweight international/EM, energy, US financials which all have the ability to seriously outperform tech this year if the reopening rotation keeps happening. 

Have you used a portfolio x ray tool that shows the weight of your individual holdings? That would be a good step to take.";investing;2021-03-11 14:59:20

I made a few quick plays and managed to pull out of everything at about 5% total loss since starting a month or so ago.  Given that what I would have probably put money into is down more than that since then, I consider the small loss a learning fee.

I am now trying to set it and forget it.  Looking at something like:

50% VTI
25% QQQM
25% DIS/AAPL

Funding a roth for the most part, maxed out last years and contributing every pay this year.  If I want to play it safer, slow and steady, is this the way to go?  I'm just looking to get more if a return than my savings account.

Is there any way on Fidelity to auto balance into these stocks when my deposit hits from payroll?  I don't want to even have to look at my account and be tempted to do stupid things again, similar to how my 401k is.

Or, read ""The Little Book of Common Sense Investing"" by John Bogle.

When you're done you'll probably find that you have 2 or 3 ETFs in your portfolio.   Or 2-3 ETF's which cover well over 90% of your portfolio and a few individual stocks you're keeping just because you believe in them long term.   

What most people miss about individual stocks is that whether a stock will win or lose is pretty much random.  Even strong companies can go down the drain in a very short period.  Moving this into a broad-market index fund like VTI means that 3500+ companies all have to do this at the same time.   Note that VTI is up 3.14% the past month, vs ARKK which is down 5.15%.

If your mom is willing to cover your losses, just move everything now.  Or talk with her about how to unwind the mess you've made.   You might want to keep and hold a few shares of a couple of the stocks if you believe in them long term (AAPL and AMZN are good examples), but things like ARKK need to go.

lol that feels like a lot when a ton of your holdings are kinda meme tech stocks. (not meme in a bad way, just very popular among reddit).

ark, icln (ouch), tsla, pltr,nio, dkng, crsr, fb, aapl are all meme to some extent... hell that's all your holdings actually.

not saying the blue chip memes are bad. they're not. dis/fb/aapl are probably your safest bets of all the holding. but whats the point of holding in ARKK when you have PLTR, DKDNG, TSLA and AAPL?

gqjkfyw;HydrocodonesForAll;4;Well so for one they're not going to give you max intrinsic value because why the fuck would they accept risk for literally nothing? Because that's what they'd be doing. They would be accepting your call contract and ALSO the potential downside that comes with that e.g. the second that contract changes hands the stock price plummets and now they're holding the bag on your worthless call. So right off they'll never give you 100% intrinsic value until literally expiration. You can see this concept in action in spreads, specifically debit spreads. If you open up a debit spread on, say, AAPL, for $120 to $130, and it IMMEDIATELY moons to $135 or something that puts both your legs immediately itm, you would be at 'max profit' , which would be the strike width, or $1000. But if you actually check out your fully itm spread, they won't be offering you the max profit, or intrinsic value, because there's inherent downside in holding an option, right?  You only get that on expiration. So the actual premium price is going to be partially intrinsic value and then a bit of whatever fucking magical math they do with the greeks to get your extrinsic value. You can even see with DEEP itm calls or leaps that it's almost all intrinsic value... but it's not fully. Because you have to give up some gains for someone else to accept your risk.;wallstreetbets;2021-03-11 06:38:00
gqjk7z5;moolium;1;I disagree with the other responses. I think your in a shitty spot. For AAPL to be 150$ by Sept, that means they'd be a 3 trillion dollar company or 2x the size that Amazon and GOOG are worth today. It would take a huge catalyst for a company to add 1 trillion to a market cap when only a handful of companies on the planet can even tout 1 trillion in value to start with. It's not impossible,  and AAPL trades much less on a multiplier than some of the tech, but that is likely due to the huge cap already and the consensus is that most other tech is overvalued.;wallstreetbets;2021-03-11 06:35:46

Never underestimate how much people are willing to spend on their pets! They had a great earnings report last month and while they expect a bit slower growth this quarter they are a very well run diverse company. 

Not flashy, pay dividends (I reinvest them) but have each given me nice gains over the time I‚Äôve owned them.

gqj85n1;Top-Emphasis6871;0;"I own about 50 different stocks, some ETFs, and a few SPAC Units. I usually allocate a big portion of my portfolio to steady growth, marginable securities (AAPL, MSFT, NVDA). Then I allocate a smaller but still sizable portion to the slower steady growth plays, which are also marginable (DIS, ATVI, EA). I then take the rest and allocate it to riskier plays, which are usually not marginable (SPACs, mainstream short-term plays, meme stocks). Then I use my margin to purchase ETFs (QQQ, SMH, etc.). The margin rate is usually much lower than the average annual return on the ETF, so it‚Äôs almost guaranteed free money.

One can‚Äôt chase in this market. So many people will get crushed chasing the mainstream plays when they‚Äôve already become mainstream. People need to find them before the general public does, ride them up, and then exit. I‚Äôve had success doing this with PTON, ZM, GME, etc. Stop orders are a friend when one‚Äôs already up a bunch. If it goes higher, one should update the stop higher. If it goes lower, one should keep the stop where it‚Äôs at. This ensures profit but also doesn‚Äôt limit upside potential.

gqis463;tearthefascistsdown;1;"&gt;Yes, well aware. IV is really high. Which is why I disagree with your assertion of 'cheap puts'.

ugh...you sound like every low limit poker player ever. Jesus

Listen, you couldve bought a put for $100 for .40 today. It peaked at $6 and closed at $2. **cheap puts** Buy them for the day...not 6 months out. 

God damn. You **very clearly** do not understand options. I am very clearly trying to help you and even using your poker knowledge to try and make sense for you.

&gt;Are you suggesting that IV is suddenly going to drop at some point?

Yes...obviously....if you are buying puts **six months out** IV will drop drastically which will....**crush** your profits before they even begin. 

&gt;Ironically, it's the exact opposite of what I was asking about: whether on a long-term basis, the stocks price would drop back to pre-squeeze levels.

You already know the answer....yes it will return to whatever the market declares GME true value to be. Is that $5? no. $20? No. $40? Maybe...$100? Also maybe. 

Its a new company now. It has new business model and new leadership. Its already proven its growing and teh (potentially)new CEO has a proven track history. 

We dont know what its ""true"" value is right now. Thats part of why this is all so nuts. I think 50-100 will be where it finally falls. Is that all you wanted? A number? 

&gt; The bid-ask for 1/1/2023 options @ 200 strike is about $140. A break-even at expiration of $60.

omg....not even 6 months out 2 years out. hahahah 150% IV right now...that shit will drop to %50 in weeks Id bet. Find an IV history chart for GME and look at what it was pre squeeze. If its 150% now....it will 2000% drop dramatically in weeks. When are you planning to sell this and why so far out dude? hahah wtf? 

&gt;I'm not keen for basically shorting GME at 60, when I can short GME for 260. Maybe I could be creative and do some sort of arbitrage, but that is closer to the 'rigged game' you reference, and the two-year options are thinly traded, so there's not a lot of fun there, view from my desk.

Like, I really am just laughing so hard here. Imagine if you were trying to teach someone to play poker who had literally no idea what the hand rankings were....but **talked** like they were an expert at the game. Thats whats going on here. This really is hilarious. 

Youre way over thinking this. Follow my plan...buy fucking shit for the week for .10-$1 and look for exits through the day. Buy low, sell **as soon as you see** a 50%+ gain. You will make money. 2023? haha gtfo 

Now, listen to me...the stock market...is the table. Do you understand? The stocks you invest in....are the hands you choose to play. AAPL will be your AA, it has **the most chance to win**. GME right now is your 65s your 33 etc. 

Every ticker you play is a hand. The entire market is the game. When  you decide to put $1 in ANYTHING you are saying ""i would like to sit down at this table and play this game""

It is **allllll** the same game. Your fucking LIFE is the game. Everything in your life is designed by someoen to extract as much money from you as possible at every turn. For every soda, for every gallon of gas, every investment, every banana, every thing is sold to you by someone trying to get as much money from you as possible. Some of those people are good and others evil.[ Some will sell you aids] (https://www.theguardian.com/world/2003/may/23/aids.suzannegoldenberg#:~:text=Yesterday%20Bayer%2C%20which%20has%20paid,%2C%20ethically%2C%20and%20humanely%22.) Knowingly 

You saw 10 tickers plummet today all at the same time with coordinated press media highlighting it instantly, some fucking pushing stories **before it happened** even.(what? haha stfu that didnt happen! It did)

You think this shit is unique to GME? Wtf? They fucked you when they hide subprime garbage in AAA securities...you have rating agencies paid off to cover it up...your government gave them billions...middle class lost billions...and you dont think this shit is fucking rigged?

Youre watching GME and you think ""damn sucks to be them. At least MY investments arent rigged!"" Are you for fucking real with this? 

Yes dude...the game is fucking rigged. Its always been rigged. Thats why they spend BBBBBBBBBBBBBBBILLIONs to rig it. Thats why the banks are the center of it all are private. Wtf is wrong with you that **even now** you still dont get it?

They arent even hiding it. 

&gt;Which is a lot closer to what I usually do.

Youre old man coffee...you invest in AA KK AK and sometimes QQ if youre feeling froggy. Thats fine. Youre still a player. Youre not the crazy LAG guys gambling away hoping to get lucky and youre not the TAG exploiting them both. Thats fine. Youre a player at the table regardless. 

&gt;I also have done a mess of consulting over 15 years for a quant company, so there are a few other things I explore, as well.
I'm out here asking a question.

And luckily Im answering all of them and more for you. Please do not buy a single option until you are familiar with the greeks at minimum. Then google IV crush and make sure you **actually** understand it. 

I am not the losing player at the table trying to give you advice without you asking. You are asking the table and I am the player who **is a proven winner** answering your question with detailed answers and explaining **more** to help you before you even get to those questions. 

why? Because I made those mistakes but I also learned a lot from people by asking one question and having them answer 5. I dont mean to come off like an ass apologies because I know i do lol";finance;2021-03-11 02:02:56

I keep CNBC on in the background most of the day.  I try to pay attention to the Fast Money crowd at noon and 5pm.  After watching the network for...way too long, I've learned personalities.  When certain ones zig when I expect them to zag, that's when their comments become investible.

Guy Adami is great for setting price targets to watch for on dips.

If uber-conservative Karen Finerman says she's taking a new position, especially if she says she just did a deep dive on the company's debt, you don't wait for a dip to follow her in. (Wish I had done this when she bough WW a couple of weeks ago at $25)

Josh Brown is great for names we like here.  Never buy when he's pounding the table, as the boomers spike it for a few minutes to a day.  But his theories are sound when ""he likes the stock"".

Dan Nathan finally got me in to AAPL after I kept missing entry points, nailed the bottom of the last major dip at $116 before it ran to 140.  He's often overly bearish so when he says to buy, I perk up.

Joe Terranova helps me expand the universe of stocks that have momentum coming that I wouldn't otherwise usually consider.

Steve Weiss can be frustrating, but he got me in (and out, and it, and out) of XPO.  I wish I had listened to Farmer Jim Lebanthal on GM 15 points before I did.

I seriously hope you're joking about this. It takes years of research and development to get where Tesla is today. Apple isn't going to be able to just dump a bunch of money into it and surpass them overnight. Nor are the EV leaders going to stay still while they catch up.

A lot of people made headlines in the last year claiming to have made solid state battery breakthroughs for example. But no one has brought one to market. And now one of the companies that claimed to have made a breakthrough in Solid state batteries is abandoning them all together after finding out they were actually really far away from getting them to work right,  and deciding it just wasn't worth pursuing farther.

While I think there's a lot of good to come in Apple's future, I'm extremely bearish about the Apple car. At best I think it'll be a toy for some ultra rich people who are willing to drop over $100,000 on a car. But as Tesla and other EV companies have shown it's very difficult to be profitable selling only very upper end cars in the EV market. The R&amp;D is just too expensive, and Apple is simply years too late to enter the market and become recognized as the leader of EV's. Tesla is already called the Apple of the auto industry for a reason.

I personally would rather Apple focus on getting their self driving car to work, and then cut deals with other auto makers to let them use it in their cars. That would have much greater potential for profits in my eyes.";investing;2021-03-10 22:21:55

gqhlqom;SurfaceToAsh;1;"To break it down:

*  Do you think its better to have fewer than 7? More? 
   * Choose 1 blue-chip, extremely strong, long lasting company from different sectors and you have a good core: stocks like KMB for Consumer, AAPL for tech, LMT for industrials, XOM for energy, JPM for Financials, O for real estate, T for Telecommunications, and JNJ for healthcare. these guys are so heavily integrated into their sectors it's very unlikely they'll ever fail. Do your DD on each core company and decide if you personally like/use their products, or what they do, and there you go. all the ones I mentioned also pay a dividend, which can be re-invested.
   * After establishing your core stocks, you can branch out; look at other compani9es in sectors like KO or ABBV or VZ or whatever you want. it's said a good spread is about 60 companies, but you can grow into that over a long amount of time.
   * Buy ETFs that cover sectors or entire markets just for extra diversification without needing extra work.
*  Do you think its the right thing to have one main stock that carries 33% weight of your portfolio?
   * If it's the right stock, yes. SPY is 50% of my retirement portfolio, chosen because it tends to outperform any regular trader. QYLD is about 20% of my portfolio, and that's a high yield, safe stock that can compound very well.
   * Normally, no single sector should dominate more than 20-25% of your portfolio, no single stock should either. however, with the really safe choices like the popular ETFs, it's fine since they tend to actually do better than any other choice you could make.
* Pros of this approach:
   * Safer
   * Pays out dividends you can re-invest or use for free capital
   * a crash in 1 sector doesn't kill your entire portfolio
* Cons to this approach:
   * More to manage
   * Requires a bit of time spent on researching companies you want to invest in
   * Grows slowly, so less chance to have an investment suddenly moon and make you rich overnight";stocks;2021-03-10 20:21:07

* Yields lower after 10-year Treasury note auction

* Indexes up: Dow 1.67%, S&amp;P 0.88%, Nasdaq 0.17% (Adds House vote, comments)

By Karen Pierog and Herbert Lash

March 10 (Reuters) - The S&amp;P 500 rose on Wednesday and the blue-chip Dow hit a record high after tepid consumer prices data for February calmed inflation worries and legislators gave final approval to one of the largest economic stimulus measures in U.S. history.

A rotation into sectors such as energy and financials continued, both in small- and large-cap stocks, as investors bet on consumer spending when the U.S. economy reopens and sold the big tech names that have fueled the rally since last March.

Accelerated coronavirus vaccine rollouts and a monster fiscal stimulus on the horizon have raised bets on higher inflation, triggering a spike in Treasury yields that pushed the Nasdaq down as much as 12% from its Feb. 12 record close.

Meanwhile, Wednesday's $38 billion 10-year Treasury note auction, which was met with modest demand, pushed the benchmark yield to a session low of 1.506%.

The ""market seemed nonplussed and Treasuries rallied but that didn't seem to give a boost to tech (stocks),"" said Mark Luschini, chief investment strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott.

Rising yields had weighed on technology shares that rely on cheap funding for growth.

The U.S. Labor Department released data that indicated the core consumer prices index, which excludes volatile items such as food and energy, rose less than expected last month.

Investors are shifting funds from tech stocks with lofty valuations to other groups, such as energy and financials, that are undervalued and more of a play on an improving economy in a post-COVID world than big tech is, said Peter Tuz, president of Chase Investment Counsel in Charlottesville, Virginia.

""It is occurring in fits and starts,"" Tuz said. ""That is essentially the overwhelming theme in the market right now and it probably will continue until these things run their course.""

The move away from Apple Inc(AAPL), Amazon.com Inc(AMZN) , Facebook(FB), Tesla and Microsoft Corp , all down on the day, included a rotation into small-cap stocks, which rose 2.0%, or double the gains of the S&amp;P 500.

Also helping lift stocks are analysts who have raised their estimates for U.S. corporate profitability this year following surprisingly strong fourth-quarter earnings and growing optimism about an economic rebound.

By 2:41 p.m. ET (1941 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 531.85 points, or 1.67%, to 32,364.59, the S&amp;P 500 gained 33.96 points, or 0.88%, to 3,909.4 and the Nasdaq Composite added 22.29 points, or 0.17%, to 13,096.11.

The Nasdaq extended gains in choppy trade after logging its best one-day percentage jump in four months on Tuesday.

The sweeping $1.9 trillion COVID-19 relief bill passed by the U.S. House of Representatives gave President Joe Biden his first major victory in office.

Some of the $1,400 in payments heading to most Americans could end up in the stock market and could provide a boost for GameStop(GME) and other stocks popular among retail investors active in online social media forums.

Trading in GameStop(GME) was volatile with the stock at times poised to set the videogame retailer on track for its longest streak of daily gains in six months and extending a rally that has already doubled the company's market value.

Among other ""meme"" stocks, Koss Corp(KOSS) climbed 49%.

Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 2.86-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.67-to-1 ratio favored advancers.

The S&amp;P 500 posted 47 new 52-week highs and no new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 283 new highs and 19 new lows.

We come here to YOLO our children‚Äôs college funds away just to post memes about it.  
Your plan was really just to put us in a position where all we have to do is hold SHARES? Say less fam. I haven‚Äôt owned a share in four years. I sold AAPL AMD and ENPH calls last week just to buy shares of GameStop and fuck you up as much as possible so we can make memes about it.

gqh768r;Chi_FIRE;1;"&gt;The federal government is indirectly invested in equities because its tax revenue will grow with the tax base, so as equities grow they'll make money from capital gains, corporate taxes, and income taxes from wealthier employees.

Good point, hadn't though of it from that perspective.

&gt; The US government is too big for the equities market. It would be one of the largest shareholders of every company, which would not be good for the health of the private sector. Imagine, for example, if the US held 10% of Exxon. They're having a contested director election right now. Who would decide how they vote?

I disagree with this point. My initial idea of a 20% equity allocation would be $600B. VTSAX alone has net assets of $1.1T, so I don't think the ""they're too big"" argument holds up in light of other larger players. For example, Vanguard is the largest holder of AAPL, with 7.48% of outstanding shares, or \~$166.5B. If SSC allocated their funds in accordance with VTSAX, they would put \~5.2% towards AAPL, or $31.2B. If this were the case, there would still be six different institutional investors with a larger ownership share of AAPL. The US govt would be approximately a 1.4% owner of AAPL.

With respect to the issue of issue of voting, I'd propose that shares held by the Social Security Trust do not have voting power.";financialindependence;2021-03-10 18:39:25

VOO vs. SPY. You probably wanna go with VOO because it has a lower expense ratio. But SPY does much higher volume so it's better for trading.

VOOG vs. VOOV. Unless you have some strong reason to believe that growth or value will outperform, I'd avoid these products. They aren't bad at all, but there's just no good reason to only own value or growth.

Personally, I wouldn't go with any of them. I'd go with VTI. It tracks the total US stock market, not just the SP500. You get everything from small cap growth to large cap value and everything in between. It's still market cap weighted, so it's not like you would own the same amount of AAPL as you would some small cap biotech company. You'd still be skewed towards large blue chip stocks. But you do also have that bit of small cap exposure which is good.

Then I would also maybe put a bit of money into international. Anywhere from 5-15%. Do not buy VT (total world stock market index) as that will have you heavily weighted into international. Just do 85-95% VTI, then 5-15% international.";stocks;2021-03-10 18:30:19

gqgvsab;futureIsYes;3;"I was stupid.

In 2015, when I started investing, I started buying MSFT, AAPL, NVDA, GOOG and BOTS, and I kept these for about 3 years, and everything was great. I sometimes forgot to check my portfolio for months. If I have kept it that way, I would have so much better return than now. 

But after the pandemic, I started listening to podcasts, spending a lot of time in reddit, etc... and started buying/selling based on recommendations from the podcasts and the reddit gang. Some has made me good money (e.g. ENPH, LVGO, PINS, etc..), but even those big gains are really not worth the time I spending and the stress I have been through the past few weeks with the tech pullback dragging me down by almost 30%.

So, now I want my sanity/time back :-) I am OK with even 5% return per year. I am not kidding, the last 3 weeks, I have spent more time at reddit, bloomberg, yahoo finance, motely fool podcasts, seeking alpha, and the like than at work... this has to stop before it completely gets out of control.";stocks;2021-03-10 17:31:16

gqgriad;reaper527;1;"personally i'm more optimistic on apple right now than disney. 

disney is letting their politics interfere with business as they remove classic movies like dumbo and peter pan from their service (which in turn means it's probably only a matter of time until they black list the movies for bluray sales / park appearances / etc.). they're also removing people from high profile successful shows like carano on the mandalorian.

at some point, if they continue going down that route it's going to bite them in the ass. nostalgia is a powerful thing and disney is opting to throw the things people are nostalgic about in the trash while kneecapping their new content.

they're not going bankrupt or tanking any time soon, i just don't see room for massive growth above and beyond what they did this year. i picked up some shares this time last year, but don't have any plans to get more. 

aapl on the other hand while having the same politics isn't letting it interfere with their business. they'll continue to grow, and if anything comes from the ""apple car"", that stock is going to explode. (yes, i realize they probably won't ""make"" a car and will probably just partner with a company that does while providing self-driving and various other tech, but the point still stands)

as far as investing **now** goes, aapl is down a bit, while dis is at all time highs. timing wise, aapl is definitely a better pickup right now. of course, rather than going all in on one with what you go for, i'd probably put like 80% in there and then put 20% in something that isn't either of them but has the chance to grow much larger (like increasing your PLTR holdings, or grabbing SFT or something like that)";stocks;2021-03-10 17:04:08

* GameStop(GME) set for longest winning streak in six months

* Futures up: Dow 0.55%, S&amp;P 0.40%, Nasdaq 0.59% (Adds comment, details; updates prices)

By Medha Singh and Shashank Nayar

March 10 (Reuters) - Major U.S. stock indexes were set to open higher on Wednesday after data showed underlying consumer prices remained tepid in February, easing concerns about a spike in inflation as an economic recovery gathers momentum.

The 10-year U.S. Treasury yield ticked lower as data showed core consumer prices index inflation rose less than expected as demand for services including airline travel gradually picked up.

Focus is on an auction of U.S. 10-year and 30-year debt later in the day for clues to where yields in the recently volatile market may be headed.

""Expectations for near-term inflation to rise is going to remain due to the huge public borrowings, but the tame inflation data that has come today would definitely drive some optimism among investors,"" said Arthur Weise, chief investment officer at Kingsland Growth Advisors in New York.

At 8:52 a.m. ET, Dow E-minis were up 176 points, or 0.55%, S&amp;P 500 E-minis were up 15.5 points, or 0.4% and Nasdaq 100 E-minis were up 75.5 points, or 0.59%.

Accelerated vaccine rollouts and a new hefty round of fiscal stimulus on the horizon have raised bets on higher inflation, triggering a sharp rise in Treasury yields that knocked off the tech-heavy Nasdaq about 7% from its Feb. 12 record closing high. The Nasdaq logged its best one-day percentage jump in four months on Tuesday, helped by a near 20% jump in Tesla Inc's(TSLA) shares as investors picked up momentum stocks that had recently taken a beating due to higher yields.

Apple Inc (AAPL), Amazon.com Inc(AMZN) and Microsoft Corp(MSFT) extended gains slightly from the previous session, while economy-linked industrial and bank stocks including Boeing Co(BA), Morgan Stanley(MS) and JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co(JPM) also added between 0.8% and 1.2%.

The chunk of a $1.9 trillion relief aid, which is on track to be signed into law later this week, is poised to end up in the stock market and could provide a boost for GameStop(GME) and other stocks popular among retail investors active in online social media forums.

Shares of GameStop(GME) jumped another 12%, setting the videogame retailer on track for its longest streak of daily gains in six months and extending a rally that has already doubled the company's market value.

Among other ""meme"" stocks, Koss Corp(KOSS) and AMC Entertainment(AMC) climbed 44% and 7.4%. (Reporting by Medha Singh and Shashank Nayar in Bengaluru; Editing by Maju Samuel)";wallstreetbets;2021-03-10 14:09:30

Other wallstreetbets Reddit stocks were mixed. AMC (AMC) followed suit trading up 7%, and Blackberry (BB) was up 2%, while Nokia(NOK) was up 2% and Palantir(PLTR) was inching toward 1% up early Wednesday.

Not sure what you mean by ‚Äúseeing a low stock price‚Äù equating to a buy, but make sure you familiarise yourself with market fundamentals before jumping in. Based on what you‚Äôre saying, you seem to be equating share price sub $50 in a company as ‚Äúgood‚Äù, when the *value* of a share relates to the company‚Äôs market cap, fundamentals and growth trajectory. Paying $3000 for an AMZN share is likely to be a better investment than RBLX at $100, for example. Final point to bear in mind, is that stock price relates to market cap.

1. AAPL: Apple is not just a tech company, it‚Äôs aggressive marketing strategy has created a culture within the company that focuses on growth and not just quality. It also has a cult. To be honest, Apple has lots of room to grow and current price is that of pennies compared to years in the future.

Azure is doing extremely well and it‚Äôs competitors (AMZN notably, whom I won‚Äôt be recommending) are a few. You can study cloud computing statistics but as someone who is actually using AMZN‚Äôs AWS and not Azure (personal preference and price difference because start up), if I had the capital, I‚Äôd be with Azure. So this is something solid you‚Äôre looking at. AMZN‚Äôs boom is because it has an upper hand but it‚Äôs business is due for a correction, in my honest opinion. Pointing at online sales from amazon.com, the competitors are catching up. The only upside is the fulfillment center and Prime Air which allows amazon to internally transfer packages from point A to B quick. Someone needs to reinvest in their business just like this and there is not a single doubt in my mind that Amazon will have an earth quake from within. Perhaps I‚Äôm paranoid, but this is what my gut says and you‚Äôre entitled to your analysis of the future.

3. TMobile/Verizon/AT&amp;T: the world is flocking towards 5G, and I am thinking that in a decade, the world is going to be so much different that it will be beyond our imagination, but we can still imagine. Think landline phones, they are damn near obsolete in homes. Even most offices are using company cell phones provided to employees that they use for business related calls. The future, imho, is that we will have unlimited internet, high speed, and we will have access to it from anywhere in the world. Realistically speaking, it‚Äôs here already, but you have to pay separately for it and it has bottlenecks right now. LTE routers are not used like they could/should/would be. I imagine, with time, we will have technology that will be a small rechargeable device which will beam extremely high-speed internet on the go. Starlink, but connected to towers. 4G LTE rechargable devices exist but you must pay extra for a data line - this is what will no longer be a thing, instesd your phone line will be the one linked to the device simultaneously as it will be like a token, so as long as you are connected to the receiver, it uses your sim as a token to connect to the tower. If your device is not connected to the LTE router, it won‚Äôt get internet service. Many implications can be made, but this is us imagining. So long telecom carriers.

The upper bound I see is the example from the VW squeeze where VW temporarily became the most valuable company in the world on paper. GME passing AAPL would be around a $35k share price.

I saw someone else reccomend and I agree because it is for a kid the RBLX IPO tommorow would be a fun speculation - When/if they get bought out a few years down the line that would be some relatively easy money again with high upside.    
AAPL and DIS are two staples of my own portfolio so you really can‚Äôt go wrong there either - but upside is slightly more limited.   
Electric cars and technology might be a fun industry to consider. Avoid Tesla at all costs, but a little research into companies like Volkswagen or Toyota who are making big strides for electric vehicles in the next year or two offers some quality potential. Their stocks have historically been limited, but if Tesla is any example, if their electric cars are a huge hit their market caps could change drastically.

AAPL products I'm not so infatuated with. It isn't a bad company, but Apple products usually appeal to people who don't understand computers.

It's good to analyze after the alert triggers. I'd just check to see what has caused the sell off. If it's something controversial like with SOS or something being pushed back in the case of SPCE I might think twice on buying. If it's just a slump and nothing has changed, in fact, positive earnings have been posted since I set the alert, as in the case with AAPL, High Tide and CRSR, then I'm definitely buying. 

The problem with this week is I just couldn't buy everything I wanted to.

Just ask yourself, has anything changed about this stock apart from the price? If the answer is no or positive then it just usually means it's on sale.

* GameStop(GME) builds on Monday's 40% surge

* Indexes up: Dow 0.74%, S&amp;P 2.01%, Nasdaq 4.10% (Updates prices, adds analyst comment)

By Herbert Lash and Karen Pierog

March 9 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks advanced on Tuesday, with the Nasdaq jumping about 4% to recoup its losses from the previous session, as U.S. bond yields retreated and investors scooped up battered technology stocks.

Tesla Inc (TSLA) jumped about 19%, while Apple Inc(AAPL) , Amazon.com Inc(AMZN) and Microsoft Corp(MSFT) gained between 3.3% and 4.4% after sharp losses in recent weeks as a rise in yields raised concerns over their high valuations.

News that a $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief package was nearing final approval sparked a spike in yields on Monday, pushing the tech-heavy Nasdaq to end more than 10% below its Feb. 12 closing high, confirming a correction for the index.

U.S. 10-year Treasury note yields eased to as low as 1.523% after hovering near 13-month highs of 1.613% in the prior session. Longer-dated yields have jumped over the last month as investors price in a faster-than-expected economic rebound and higher inflation.

The market is adjusting to the new level in interest rates, said Kristina Hooper, chief global market strategist at Invesco in New York. Companies whose products and services are in demand when the economy is doing well, known as cyclicals, and small-cap stocks will outperform this year, she said. Tech will end the year higher but not be the leader as it was in the past year's rally.

""Today the 10-year is down a bit, and that takes pressure off valuations, so tech is performing well,"" Hooper said. ""The market is just about getting comfortable at this level of rates.""

Rising interest rates disproportionately hurt high-growth tech companies because they are valued on earnings expected years into the future rather than profits earned in the short term.

""Potential headwind for the market is (when) interest rates rise further from this point over the short period ... since they have risen too fast in too little time,"" said Michael Sheldon, chief investment officer at RDM Financial in Westport, Connecticut.

By 2:50 p.m. ET (1950 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 234.05 points, or 0.74%, to 32,036.49, the S&amp;P 500 gained 76.96 points, or 2.01%, to 3,898.31 and the Nasdaq Composite added 517.57 points, or 4.1%, to 13,126.73.

The rise in Treasury yields has accelerated a rotation from ""stay-at-home"" winners to stocks primed to benefit from an economic reopening, setting the blue-chip Dow on pace to end at a record high on Tuesday.

While the Russell 2000 growth index jumped over 3.2% on Tuesday, compared to a 0.7% rise in Russell 2000 value index , it has sharply underperformed its value counterpart since the start of the month.

Shares of Tesla surged 19% on Tuesday, rebounding from a deep sell-off and putting the automaker on track for its largest one-day gain in nearly eight years.

The global economic outlook has brightened as vaccine rollouts gain speed and the United States launches a massive new stimulus package, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development said, hiking its 2021 growth forecasts.

The Democrat-controlled U.S. House of Representatives will take up the relief bill on Wednesday, with the chamber's expected approval leading to President Joe Biden's signing the legislation into law later this week.

The bank index dropped 0.39% after vaulting to a new 14-year peak. Economy-linked financials, materials and industrials hovered near record highs.

GameStop (GME) was up 22%, building on Monday's rise of over 40% on the video retailer's e-commerce strategy and speculation that small investors will pour stimulus checks into markets.

Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 2.31-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 3.58-to-1 ratio favored advancers.

The S&amp;P 500 posted 37 new 52-week highs and no new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 214 new highs and 15 new lows.

gqd0pqb;ReflectAA;2;"I mean... This is really broad. What part do you not understand? 

General example. I‚Äôm not taking an hour to do real calculations so these are all made up numbers that may or may not actually make sense in detail. 

AAPL is currently $125 a share. You think AAPL will increase to $140 by Sept 1, so you buy Sept 1st options that are tied to a price (strike) $140. Those options cost $70. You buy 2. 

On may 28th, the price is $160 a share. At that point the option has a bunch of value because $160 - $140 = $20 in savings per share, minus what the options cost. Since you bought 2, that‚Äôs 200 shares = $4,000 in savings. The options are trading at $180. You can now do one of three things: 

A) You sell your options at $180 for a profit. $220 in total profits because $360 - $140 =

B) You exercise the options and chip in the extra money to buy 200 Apple shares. You‚Äôd have to chip in $140 X 200 = $28,000. Your net savings for having bothered with any of this is $20 X 200 = $4,000 - $360 = $3,640. If you actually sell those shares immediately at $160 then that $3,640 is your profit. If you hold the shares then your profit is $3,640 plus or minus whatever ‚Äúnormal‚Äù profit you get, pretending you bought the shares at $160. 

C) you do nothing and try your luck waiting longer, where you can either make more or lose out.";stocks;2021-03-09 19:10:37

If not, things may get cooking again and SPY can break over this stubborn resistance line. We shall see, I have no idea where it'll go. Personally, I'm not loading back up on tech.

gqcca4n;ionized_fallout;22;"LONDON (Reuters) - Investors are estimated to have made billions of dollars from their bearish bets on Tesla and big tech stocks in the recent knee-jerk selloff triggered by a jump in U.S. Treasury yields, data from financial analytics firm Ortex showed on Tuesday.

Tesla was short-sellers' biggest win, giving them estimated profits of $4.2 billion so far in 2021, followed by more than $1 billion gains each on Zoom Video and Apple(AAPL), according to Ortex.

They were however burnt by betting against videogame maker Gamestop(GME). The company, which was at the heart of the so-called ""stonks"" retail trading mania, has jumped another 400% in the past two weeks as amateur investors have jumped back in.

GameStop's (GME) e-commerce strategy plans were seen driving this week's renewed gains in January's ""meme"" stocks, alongside speculation that small investors will use their upcoming stimulus checks to trade.

In other major bets, investors made about $1 billion from shorting QQQ, an ETF that tracks the performance of the Nasdaq 100. The tech-heavy benchmark hit correction territory on Monday, slipping more than 10% from record highs.

* GameStop(GME) builds on Monday's 40% surge

* Indexes up: Dow 0.53%, S&amp;P 1.49%, Nasdaq 3.17% (Adds comment, details; updates prices)

By Shashank Nayar and Medha Singh

March 9 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks advanced on Tuesday, with the Nasdaq jumping over 3% to recoup its losses in the previous session as U.S. bond yields retreated and investors picked up battered technology stocks.

Among the biggest boosts to the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq were Tesla Inc(TSLA), Apple Inc(AAPL), Amazon.com Inc(AMZN), Facebook Inc(FB) and Microsoft Corp(MSFT) jumped between 2.4% and 7.2% after sharp losses in recent weeks as a rise in yields raised concerns over their high valuations.

Signs that a $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief package was closing in on final approval sparked a spike in yields on Monday, pushing the tech-heavy Nasdaq to end more than 10% below its Feb. 12 closing high that confirmed a correction.

U.S. 10-year Treasury bond yields eased to 1.54% after hovering near 13-month highs of 1.613% in the prior session. Longer-dated yields have jumped over the last month as investors price in a faster-than-expected economic rebound and higher inflation.

Higher yields can weigh even more on tech and growth stocks with lofty valuations, as they threaten to erode the value of their longer-term cash flows.

""Tech stocks are overdue for some kind of bounce after the downfall they have had so far with most investor maintaining a positive outlook (on them) in the medium to longer term,"" said Michael Sheldon, chief investment officer at RDM Financial in Westport, Connecticut.

""Potential headwind for the market is if interest rates rise further from this point over the short period... since they have risen too fast in too little time.""

At 9:59 a.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 168.01 points, or 0.53%, to 31,970.45, the S&amp;P 500 gained 57.06 points, or 1.49%, to 3,878.41 and the Nasdaq Composite gained 399.55 points, or 3.17%, to 13,008.71.

The rise in yields has accelerated a rotation from ""stay-at-home"" winners to stocks primed to benefit from an economic reopening, helping the blue-chip Dow hit an intraday record high on Monday.

The global economic outlook has brightened as vaccine rollouts gain speed and the United States launches a massive new stimulus package, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development said, hiking its 2021 growth forecasts.

The U.S. House of Representatives could approve the relief bill as early as Tuesday, with a vote allowing the Democratic president to sign the legislation into law later this week.

The bank index dropped 2% after vaulting to a new 14-year peak. Financials and energy sectors were in the red.

GameStop (GME) was up 18%, building on Monday's rise of over 40% on the video retailer's e-commerce strategy and speculation that small investors will pour stimulus checks into markets.

Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 2-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and by a 3.2-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq.

The S&amp;P 500 posted 15 new 52-week highs and no new low, while the Nasdaq recorded 131 new highs and eight new lows. (Reporting by Shashank Nayar and Medha Singh in Bengaluru; Editing by Maju Samuel)";wallstreetbets;2021-03-09 15:16:51

gqbo4bb;BoyW1thADragonTattoo;1;""" tesla actually makes close to 25% on each car and that's before fsd""

I thought the number was closer to 20%, but I'm not going to quibble over 5%. Regardless, Toyota promises similar levels of profit per car (around 15-20% range). It's a competitive advantage to be sure, but not enough to justify their valuation so far beyond what their competitors, who have more capacity, more experience and more 

""meanwhile ford is drowning in debt and LOSING money on each mach e""

That's actually not the case, Ford is generating a profit on each Mach-E before RnD costs are taken into account. However, if we take RnD costs into account, they'll be strictly in the black from 2024 onwards. 

""Btw why doesn't anyone mention ford's actual market share, people mention telsas decrease but don't address the fact ford market share is still miniscule""

Going from 0-20% in a month is not miniscule, their production is only just starting and that's a great start. I'm waiting to see what happens when the Japanese muscle into this market though, they've a better history on RnD and efficiency. 

""Here is a riddle, name literally one iconic cisco product. If you name one then I'll know you are a network engineer. Meanwhile aapl has iphone, Iwatch, ipad etc. And tesla had model3 models, especially the model x, and model y, and soon the cybertruck.""

You've got me there, I'm an anthropologist. However, iconic products doesn't always translate to great companies. Cisco's used as an example because they were a great, profitable company that was simply overvalued compared to what it was. Which is what I think Tesla is right now. Once it falls down to 50-100 USD per share, it'll be trading at a fair and reasonable price. I can understand if it's trading within the 100-200 USD range on a serious premium.

gqb9d46;BuffettsBrokeBro;1;"You‚Äôre right, the point is opportunity cost. The problem is that stocks often don‚Äôt respond rationally. Take AAPL dropping along with the NASDAQ the last few weeks. The thesis to get into the company at pre drop prices and to hold for the long term was strong, and remains strong. But it continues to bleed.

The issue is when that bleeding or stagnation leads either to panic or frustration. So, you sell your position either for something else solid with higher growth potential, or potentially FOMO into something on a run. It could work out well, and you see good, much quicker, gains. Or, the stock you go into might trade sideways or drop, and the stock you got of rockets.

As much as people FUD Facebook with legislative headwinds and the ‚Äúdying‚Äù on the Facebook platform itself, it has incredible amounts of cash on hand and is successful in multiple industry verticals. Any break-up could actually benefit shareholders (getting shares in all the component companies.

As a result, people are getting at the relatively safety of holding FAANG stocks - that they will ultimately go up again - together with the likelihood of further growth.

gqb4uxw;fuckthedebt;1;"well, the Nasdaq closed just below the 100 SMA and that adds another negative to the bearish technicals. Doing this it broke throgh last thursdays low and made a complete engulfing reversal of Friday's gains.

So, charts would say watch out but I have some gut feelings: Although we did close lower than thursdays low, we are just below the 100 SMA and there is still a possibility that the index can demonstrate that this was a short term bottom, if it holds and bounces off somewhat.  

Optimists would say yesterday could be establishing a second ST bottom test, even though we went through thursday's close but we did spend almost the entire day above.  I think we need to see a jump above thursdays close and hold or, at most, retest yesterdays close intraday, to get past this week.  

We did reach a full 10% correction on close but we actually touched 13% on Mondays low of 12397 and we bounced strongly off that. If I look at the intraday low monday and tuesday, they improved, inspite of the close.  

Its amazing to see the Nasdaq crumble when the rest of the maket flies. I think this is the largest correction on record while the rest of the market has stabilized and gone higher.  A little pay back for outpacing the rest of the market last year. Still, growth is becoming realtively well priced to value and that rotation trade can easily rotate back in a moment. If you are a stock picker, I think you can begin to average in names that previously got away, like Qcom or SWKS or AAPL. They will look cheap based on next reported earnings and guidance which, finally, should become very optomistic based on the reopening. 

Conclusion: Inconclusive, we need to see the index close above last thursdays low as a first step to recovery and not go back to the intraday lows of monday and yesterday before we get risk on.    13000 and 13200 now look like resistence so, if the index has put in a bottom, look for volatility to remain.  Wildcard remains rates stabilizing.  The index has probably absorebed rates of 1.5-1.6 but, if we get to 1.65 or 1.7 quickly, all bets are off. 

I am actually long the ndx at a loss, so I am in the wishful thinking camp that we have bottomed but, if I was not long, I would only trade it on an intraday basis until we get back quarter end or some of the technicals strengthen.  Bonds are oversold so a short term rally there would translate well for the Nasdaq.

So much depends on AAPL, GOOG, FB, AMZN.   Many Semi stocks and some fangs have seen 20% corrections
We are overdue for a few days relief rally before going back to test the bottom again.";StockMarket;2021-03-09 08:44:42

gqb30zw;Hotrian;1;"&gt; I didn't realize that to have recent data it cost money

The URL I used was for the price target - not the current price, so it hasn't been updated in some time. If you want the current price, you can check the quote: https://finnhub.io/api/v1/quote?symbol=AAPL&amp;token=sandbox_aaaaaaaaaa which returns the following:

```
{
  ""c"":116.36,
  ""h"":121,
  ""l"":116.21,
  ""o"":120.93,
  ""pc"":121.42,
  ""t"":1615248000
}
```

According to the documentation, `c` is the current price, `h` is the high price (of the day), `l` is the low price (of the day), `o` is the open price, `pc` is the previous close, and `t` is not documented - I assume it's a timestamp.

You can also use websockets or webhooks to get _live_ data, where calling the `/quote/` url is limited by the 60 checks/minute rate limit.

&gt; Also this all looks like it's python ...

The examples I linked are in Python, but the documentation includes a few other versions. They're HTTP ""GET"" requests, so basically it applies to any language. The returned data is in JSON, which is just a string of data formatted a certain way.

You can make HTTP GET requests in C, [here is an example using libcurl](https://curl.se/libcurl/c/https.html).";wallstreetbets;2021-03-09 08:14:57

gq9bqlu;steakandp1e;1;"I follow aapl a lot which is why it's my largest holding and it's a long term one which is why I have shares. Historically aapl actually barely moves on product announcements alone. If you look at it's movements after product events over time, the only one which has produced a statistically significant average move is WWDC which is in June. If a new buyback announcement comes that would be great and could potentially reverse the direction its going in but it's hard to estimate if such an announcement would occur and how big it would be.

AAPL is a great company no doubt and it's earnings were great but even though its market cap has increased 40% since pre covid, it's revenues and earnings have not increased that much. That increase is a product of economic environment where low interest rates and lack of growth anywhere else made tech the best place to put money over the last year. As a result the tech P/E ratios are highest they've ever been. Things are changing so even though AAPL has increased revenue and earnings a decent amount, if we go back to its pre covid P/E levels it should be priced around 85.33. ([https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/AAPL/apple/pe-ratio](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/AAPL/apple/pe-ratio))

Basically aapl along with other big tech names are kinda fucked short term as they drift towards lower P/E ratios. I'm speculating here but I don't think it'll be a full on crash because they are good companies and people will be buying to average down throughout the drop (like we saw last friday and last monday), but nonetheless it'll be a slow bleed.

gq92sor;ionized_fallout;7;"March 8 (Reuters) - The Dow climbed on Monday, led by stocks poised to benefit the most from an economic rebound as the $1.9 trillion COVID-19 relief bill awaited a final Congressional vote this week, and heavyweight tech-related stocks swung between gains and losses.

After the legislation won U.S. Senate approval on Saturday, President Joe Biden said he hoped for a quick passage of the revised coronavirus relief package by the Democrat-controlled House of Representatives so he could sign it and send $1,400 direct payments to Americans.

Prospects of more government spending and faster economic growth have stoked fears of a spike in inflation, sending the benchmark 10-year Treasury yield to near one-year highs.

U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, however, said on Monday the package would fuel a ""very strong"" U.S. recovery and she did not expect the economy to run too hot because of the increased spending.

The Dow hit a new record intraday high and was trading above its Feb. 24 record close. In the S&amp;P 500, the financial sector was the biggest boost, hitting a record as higher interest rates and a steeper yield curve helped banks. Industrials were right behind, also reaching a record high, while the materials sector neared an all-time peak. The technology sector was deepest in the red.

""This is an ideal traders' market with certain sectors and individual stocks performing better than the wider market, as investors pick and choose individual stocks that will perform better as the economy reopens,"" said Anthony Denier, chief executive officer of trading platform Webull.

A slide in the big tech stocks that have driven the rally in equities since pandemic-induced lows of last March continued, with Apple Inc(AAPL), Nvidia Corp(NVDA), Tesla Inc(TSLA) and Alphabet Inc's(GOOG) Google leading declining shares on Nasdaq.

Tech stocks are particularly sensitive to rising yields because their value rests heavily on earnings in the future, which are discounted more deeply when bond returns go up.

The divergence between the tech stocks and non-tech stocks explains trading today, said Joe Saluzzi, partner and co-founder of Themis Trading in Chatham, New Jersey.

""The stimulus package will be certainly helping the bigger cap names,"" Saluzzi said, referring to non-tech stocks. ""The get-out and non-stay at home stocks are doing better now,"" he said.

By 3:09 p.m. ET (2009 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 416.64 points, or 1.32%, to 31,912.94, the S&amp;P 500 lost 3.83 points, or 0.10%, to 3,838.11 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 259.71 points, or 2.01%, to 12,660.44.

Banks added about 1.7% as the yield on the benchmark 10-year note stood near a 13-month high, while airlines jumped about 5%.

Walt Disney Co (DIS) jumped about 5.8% as California health officials set new rules that would allow Disneyland and other theme parks, stadiums and outdoor entertainment venues to reopen as early as April 1.

GameStop Corp (GME) surged about 33% after the company said it had tapped shareholder Ryan Cohen to lead a transition to an e-commerce business.

Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.68-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.28-to-1 ratio favored advancers.

The S&amp;P 500 posted 124 new 52-week highs and no new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 390 new highs and 21 new lows.

The company is known for three projects in particular: Palantir Gotham, Palantir Metropolis, and Palantir Foundry. Palantir Gotham is used by counter-terrorism analysts at offices in the United States Intelligence Community (USIC) and United States Department of Defense.[6] In the past, Gotham was used by fraud investigators at the Recovery Accountability and Transparency Board, a former US federal agency which operated from 2009 to 2015. Gotham was also used by cyber analysts at Information Warfare Monitor, a Canadian public-private venture which operated from 2003 to 2012. Palantir Metropolis is used by hedge funds, banks, and financial services firms.[7][8] Palantir Foundry is used by corporate clients such as Morgan Stanley, Merck KGaA, Airbus, and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV.[9]";wallstreetbets;2021-03-08 19:34:53

gq8t67m;aybabay5;1;"Okay so let me explain what I meant and how I‚Äôm using these terms. 

The first batch (AXP, HLT, MAR, JPM). I consider these ‚Äúvalue‚Äù stocks because they‚Äôre highly profitable companies with relatively low growth. To me, a ‚Äúvalue‚Äù stock is simply a stock that‚Äôs focused primarily on profitability and not on growing the business. I am not saying that these are a value proposition. I‚Äôm using the term to define the stage a business is in.

The second batch (AAPL, AMZN, SQ, AMD) are more on the growth side (especially SQ), but I think they‚Äôre a tremendous value right now. You can buy AAPL at 32x earnings? That‚Äôs a fantastic deal.";stocks;2021-03-08 19:23:53

gq8t1ep;steakandp1e;2;I'm holding a fuck ton of aapl shares so obviously I want this to be true but look around. The writing is on the wall. Tech isn't the place to be when the market is fearing inflation and there's a sector rotation into reopening / value stocks. The simplest way to put it is that tech companies do not represent as much growth anymore relative to the rest of the market because commodities, travel, leisure, and energy are going to grow faster in the coming months. If they don't represent as much relative growth for the near term, their share prices will go down. Look at 2016 and 2018. All these great tech companies were still great then, but the environment was changing with different interest rates and that didn't stop these tech companies from dropping 20%+. No doubt they'll come back once we're passed the reopening boom in a few months, but April is kinda risky for those OTM calls.;wallstreetbets;2021-03-08 19:22:55

gq8sgcd;Lord_Python_Of_WSB;1;"&gt;a stock should not double unless some income also basically doubles

What? You must be new to investing if that's what you think , share price reflect the future value and potential to create more value of a company generally not the other way around  and aapl was trading at a huge discount.
Also stock barely trade at a fair value , they are mostly trading under or over the actual value.

I can't believe what I'm reading.  There are a billion factored into Share price,  if it was a simple oh this company makes this much so this is how much it worth  there wouldn't be hundreds of thousands of analysts getting paid 6 figure to analyze a company to the bone.

Both aapl and pltr are over value but if you had to compare aapl vs pltr only , aapl looks fking cheap AF .

Aapl is trading at 32 p.e and forward p.e  of high 20s

What's the forward p.e for pltr ?

An undervalue stock has a easier time to double and become overvalued than an overvalued stock to double to become-out-of-this-universe-valued stock regardless of market cap.

Aapl is a very bad if not the worse stock to use in your case.

Try another stock.";wallstreetbets;2021-03-08 19:18:40

For example, TXN has some fabs, but they are old technology (still a descent market especially for analog chips). MU has fabs but mainly for memory (memory and logic CMOS are different in manufacting). There are also markets for power semiconductor, optical sensors and etc. For advanced SoC chips, only major players left right now are TSM and INTC.

gq86mly;AntiochusIV;1;"When you short a stock, you borrow shares from your broker. 

Let‚Äôs say you‚Äôre using fidelity and you want to short one share of AAPL, which is trading at $100. When you click ‚Äúsell short‚Äù fidelity lends you one share of AAPL that they have on hand, which you immediately sell for a $100 profit. Because you‚Äôre borrowing it, you need to give them one AAPL share back at some point, and you pay interest on it in the mean time.

Your goal is to buy it back at a lower price, then give it back. So if you sell short at $100 and then the price of AAPL falls to $50, you buy back that one share of AAPL at $50 and give it to your broker.

$100 up front - $50 to buy back = $50 profit from the share price falling.

The same thing happens the other direction: if AAPL rises to $200 you‚Äôll have to buy back at $200 which will mean you lose $100.

If you short a stock at $20 and it goes up to $200, you lose $180 per share you‚Äôve shorted which adds up to a lot of money. If your broker doesn‚Äôt think you‚Äôll be able to afford buying back when the price goes higher, you get margin called and are required to add funds to your account. If you can‚Äôt do that, you are required to immediately buy back (cover) at the current price so the broker doesn‚Äôt lose all of their shares.";wallstreetbets;2021-03-08 16:45:38

gq82mlf;crownpr1nce;1;"I'm not sure why you'd want to compare it to an index. It's not really related. You can look at past returns as an indicator, but no need to compare it to the an index. I guess it can be helpful if you don't know the past market patterns to compare it to, but then I'd suggest learning the general shape of the S&amp;P 500 over the last 10 years or so. Learn the general dates of bull runs and major corrections, it'll help more then comparing charts. And the importance of past returns is relatively small. It gives a flawed picture. The best things to look at are in the more business details. How are their earnings growing? What is their margin and how does that change over time? 

The reason you don't want to look at passed return too much and why it could be misleading is many fold. Why did they grow so much? Were they in their growth phase? Are they still or are they ""mature""? Are they overvalued like you mentioned? Did 4 new competitors come in with a strong competition that will slow their growth/bake their revenue drop? 

That all being said, what you said can still apply in some cases, usually in blue chips if that is what you're after. Even then you still have to look at if anything impactful changed in their sector or business. But AAPL past returns are a pretty good indicator of future returns unless something unpredictable happens. Same for say MSFT.

gq7w9tv;yy1500;1;"got it.. good.perspective.. that said.. msft has massive share volume and manages to move around a lot. realistically, a smaller company should be able to grow faster.. ie there is little reason for aapl to double its stock proce when so large.. but there is every reason to think a pivoting companys stock should rocket when it moves to a new space.

amount of float seems to be the main reason people think this is an issue.. but its possible buybacks and increased company efforts will introduce volatility to the stock which would be a good thing.

Even though $AAPL is already a big company, that doesn't mean it can't grow bigger and faster.
