gk44ese;CityForAnts;;2021-01-21 22:53:02;16;"No worries, this is not too simple.  ETFs hold a bunch of shares of other stocks.  The Net Asset Value is the value of all of the holdings per share of the ETF.  If ETF A holds 10 shares of stock B valued at $100 a share, the ETF A owns a total value of $1,000.  Let’s say there are 50 outstanding shares on ETF A, which gives a NAV of $20 on ETF A.  If ETF A is trading at $22, that $2 difference is called a “premium”.  It means you are paying more for the ETF than the value of everything the ETF holds.  Market makers (like the arbitrators of the market, scraping gains from small inefficiencies in the market), can correct this premium/discount since the ETF share price should eventually converge on the NAV.  I’m not an expert either but that’s my understanding.

And on the IPO topic, IPOs are just as difficult to value as any other company.  So market makers don’t have a value to go off.";[];investing

Here's what's happening at Citron HQ:

1) Citron traders looking at big losses on their short in their blotter, starting to panic. They can't even average up. 2) The usual shtick of quietly taking a big short position and then leveraging media to get less informed traders to tank the stock is not working (This particular video even feels desperate to me). 3) Citron's risk department is telling the traders to reduce exposure, but they can't. If they do, the stock will spike up even faster and they'll have to cover even more of their position, etc.

Long story short, they're fucked.

To be clear, short selling is a completely legitimate activity. The world is better off knowing which companies are fairly priced and which ones cook the books. But the way these vultures try to manipulate others into doing their bidding is unscrupulous.

This short trade is a lemon, Citron man. Cover your ass and go lick your wounds while you still have money.";[];wallstreetbets

gk41vt5;F1remind;;2021-01-21 22:32:16;45;"I think he got exactly everything wrong.

""I know, everyone on reddit is a genious and every trade is a win"" - Has he ever heard about GOURDS? Never have I seen people posting with such a pride that they were willing to risk everything for a better life and they may have lost everything but at least they gave it everything they had. And everyone here claims or is retarded so it's hard to get that even more wrong.


""We're not in the middle of a short squeeze, the shorts are still very high"" - bitch how is that an argument to not go long?!? The borrowing fees are low _for GME standards_! It's still at 30% per annum. If your credit card provider raised their fees to 30% you'd probably try to sue them, boomer! And the stock being heavily shorted has always been one reason to go long. The shorts will eventually have to cover and probably lost over one billion dollars by now. At some point they will cut their losses and I don't give a damn if GME has the right to sell stock for 100m USD. That's diluting the share value by less than 5%, we gained over 10% today so that's nothing. 


""RC holds 9m shares, he could sell them! Even if the shares went to 0 he'd be richer than me or you!"" Well the last part is right but that boomer doesn't understand how this works. RC has more money than he could possibly ever spend and a dog he's happy with. GME isn't just an investment for RC, it's his project. He will put a lot into this to turn this around because he'd be bored if he retired. He could just play gold all day, hedge his wealth and live in his mansion but those are boomer dreams. He wants to get shit done. 

He even mentioned RC's letter, then complained that Sherman hasn't implemented it and that the leadership is still the same so GME will stay a retail business with no future. Technically RC is not in the board of directors yet but that's like saying ""Today the sun will stay up. It has been up since this morning and still not gone down, I'm betting it will stay up. And the closer it gets to the horizon then I'll bet even harder.""";[];wallstreetbets

I got in at 18$. Held when we went down to 10-11$. It was brutal at times. I don't know what caused the recent surge that caused it to break all barriers and get to 42$, but I sure am glad I held.

The more I read about it, the more I realize that the best thing we can do right now is just hold. And wait. The shorts lose money every day. We don't.

gk3zuw7;moltch;;2021-01-21 22:15:59;15;"Alright I'm gonna drop a few potential moves for any fools looking for a play the next two weeks. 

TSLA 30 day IV percentile has dropped to ""moderate"" levels. They have earnings on the 27th and have had no run up this week. We all know it's a meme stock and will, in my opinion, push 1,000 a share if earnings are anything but a disaster (musk wont let them be). So how do we profit? 

Move 1: Buy a calendar spread with one leg expiring in March and the other leg expiring in september. Strikes don't really matter but try to keep them above 1,000 as to avoid going ITM before earnings. Now right before earnings, when IV is highest, we sell the spread. We profit bigly if IV goes from ""moderate"" to ""high"" (it will). By selling before earnings we will avoid the IV crush. 

Move 2: By a naked call with a Feb 5 $1000 strike. Right now this option has a .15 delta and is considered ""unlikely"" to expire ITM. With a good earnings TSLA will surpass or hit 1,000 a share in my opinion. If you wait until closer to earnings this option will be much pricier due to the vega spike. 

Move 3: After we've sold our TSLA calendar spread right before earnings, switch over and sell a shit ton of ATM puts. IV will be at its highest at this point. We will make mad money from the IV crush that follows earnings as long as tesla's price doesn't tank.

gk3zuhn;Bendetto4;;2021-01-21 22:15:54;40;"Why would you sell at below market price.  

Also the statistics show that the depression in price comes from borrowed shares being sold. They dump 100k shares and it drops hard and paper hand bitches sell and they buy to cover their costs and it pings straight back up. 

Its pure market manipulation by the short players. Insiders have to make a declaration that they are selling,  and set a target price and a date for the sale. So they aren't putting any more shares on the market. Same with issuing more shares as the company. 

Right now there is no way out for the shorts. They keep borrowing to cover their positions and every time the price goes up they are losing big money because they need to cover the new high. 

As it stands there are 80 million shares worth of shorts expiring tomorrow. 16 million shares worth of calls. Now, they could have covered these positions already, buying steadily over the last week. 

Now I'm not an expert, and there is probably something I'm missing. But as I see it they have to buy shares, cover their positions then buy shares again in order to cover all the positions that expire TOMORROW. 

Thats not taking into account all the positions that expire next week, or next month. Every time the price dips then jumps, thats them shorting the stock, then covering last week's calls. So long as the bottom of the dip is higher than the strike price, we have them trapped. Today it dipped to $37, but only briefly, I maintain that shorts are fucked.";[];wallstreetbets

Absolutely.  The idea is that most of your shares will be purchased by short sellers who desperately NEED to get their shares back.  This is good.  However, some of your shares will also be purchased by retail investors who try to catch a rocket ship to the moon at the last minute and become bag-holders. 

Don't be a bag-holder.  You absolutely have to get out at the right level of risk tolerance for you.  In theory, we could all hold together and refuse to sell and drive the shorts bankrupt.  In reality, people will drop out when they sense their profit is good enough, which is why the shorts won't squeeze to true infinity.

gk3w29q;OlyBomaye;;2021-01-21 21:46:41;53;"The truth is this post is 100% correct.  But the reason it's correct, is while many of us have a cost basis that can take an enormous pullback, I would hazard to guess at this point that many in this sub have a cost basis that is super fucking high relative to the stock price because they do the classic ""buy high sell low"" strategy because they can't take the roller coaster ride.  They'll buy the top, and on the other side of the squeeze, they'll be the ones who are financially ruined.

2. People are comparing the END OF CYCLE NUMBERS to the start of the cycle. Comparing December numbers where there was massive lockdown where retailers left and right are closing stores is going to hurt GME. No SHIT SHERLOCK. With the difficulty  in procuring any gaming hardware in general, just look at PC hardware or PS5/Xbox Series X, of course sales will be down in general. Most of their business ""AT THE MOMENT"" is still retail, they're not going to post gang buster numbers in December. Instead what we'll most likely see is a spread out increase in their earnings over several quarters as opposed to all front loaded as they normally are in the holiday season.
3. Their E-Commerce jumped 300% also same as 2. They are comparing literally end of cycle numbers, PANDEMIC lockdown, supply shortages and zero rev from Microsoft shared earnings are included in there. I thought the market is forward looking not backwards.
4. Hedge funds are WRONG ALL THE FUCKEN TIME just look at TSLA. Only time will tell how high GME will go but at this price point you are dead fucken wrong. As for GME, these retards were at the fucken sleep at the wheel, when GME traded at 3$, any fucken person with a brain cell would of closed out their position after a 98% possible GAIN and put their capital elsewhere. These ""reputable hedge fund"" are fucken greedy pigs that are getting slaughtered.
5. Except they're SPECIFICALLY SAID in their earnings THEY DO NOT NEED MONEY. Q3 earnings transcript THIS QUESTION WAS ASKED SPECIFICALLY, THEY SHOT BACK AND SAID THEY DO NOT NEED IT AT ALL. They are sitting on 500m CASH and paying back debt EARLY, they're going to be swimming in cash from the new console cycle, THEY HAVE 102m STILL ALLOCATED CASH TO STOCK BUYBACK.

*Do you hear the people sing?*  
*Singing a song of angry men?*  
*It is the music of a people*  
*Who will not be slaves again*

*When the beating of your heart*  
*Echoes the beating of the drums*  
*There is a life about to start*  
*When tomorrow comes*

*Will you join in our crusade?*  
*Who will be strong and stand with me?*  
*Beyond the barricade*  
*Is there a world you long to see?*  
*Then join in the fight*  
*That will give you the right to be free*

*Do you hear the people sing?*

https://i.imgur.com/tUhyV7p.png
I transcribed the image below

""Why does everyone bring up free float like that matters lmao? If NOK hits $10 the amount of outstanding shares will not matter. Stop fear mongering and stomping on shit before it begins. Nokia is the future I can’t post comments cause my account isn’t thirty days old. And you keep yapping your jaw like you know something. My calls are up and you’re broke and mad. Bozo All you’re doing is regurgitating garbage takes. Learn to this for yourself. NOK is getting infrastructure contracts from all over the world and has a contract to put the first cellular network on the more. Next warning report it’s going to Mars. No one gives a shot about your fundamentals, boomer. Go buy stock in Apple think *moon Earnings Yeah my grammar is fucked but whatever. Imagine calling someone a pussy cause they dmed you. Like I said I’m not allowed to post comments cause this is a new account, and even if I was I wouldn’t wanna expose you as the retard you are for shouting nonsense into the void. Dickhead. Look at your comment history. Salty as fuck. “Let’s do spy put lottos but fuck the company that is mooning 8% in the last month. Truly autistic and most likely in the red. Neck yourself Remember when the Steelers were 11-0? 💀💀💀""

Today was a good day. 

I bought stocks at opening which felt great. 

Then some meanie Citron cancelled their shitshow as he didnt know how to increase his bandwidth. 

Then we had some great up and downs and we were able to convince some random internet show to buy GME stocks.

GME held, once again. And we even went up for almost 10%!

One day at a time!

Translation: right before options expire, delta changes with respect to the underlying price really fast. Say we're trading at $43, calls for $44 would go from a delta of 0.4 to a delta of 0.6 by the time it gets to $45. That means that the MM has to buy 10 shares for every option contract they've sold for every dollar it goes up. Open Interest at 45 is 6.5k options. So as it approaches and passes 45, the MM has to buy 130k shares. This happened today when we went past 40 a few times. That's why the dildos around $40 are so big.";[];wallstreetbets

Good stuff there.  Verify it after with more research.


What I'm seeing is cherry picked numbers by the shorts in a lot of media.  While a lot of short term research is showing a sell rating, others like market edge give it a Long rating with an improving score of 0 on a scale of 0 to -4.  They upgraded from neutral on 8/17/2020 and it's gone up 647% since then.


Ford equity research has it at Average rating (upgraded from below average) and the average was reiterated on 1/15/2021.  What average means is that they expect it to perform in line with the market over the next 6-12 months.


What I see being priced in with stock prices rising is the closure of underperforming stores and a pivot to e-commerce while maintaining their retail core competencies.


The negative rants from shorts I hear too.  I'm hearing cherry picked numbers that do look bad on the surface as well as anecdotal evidence pointing to blockbuster and other dead chains.  GME might be late to the party, but i don't see any other brick &amp; mortar retailer in their market that is better positioned to make the transition.  Ryan Cohen brings a lot to the table to help make such a metamorphosis possible.  Look what he did with Chewy.";[];wallstreetbets

1. The short squeeze won't happen
 - ""Why is there a high short interest?"" 
 - $40 - Open borrow at decent rate
 - Plenty of options 
 - Trading phenomenom - A lot of call volume 
	- He has no problems selling the company higher 
	- As long as borrow is available, insiders are still selling, and company needs money, there will be no squeeze

2. Numbers don't lie
 - Citron was first short sellers to start going long on Tesla 
 - NPD report on GME. Harper Sales up 23%, GME down 9% - losing to Amazon, best buy, target, walmart 
 - Current business is drowning

3. Valuations matter
 - This is a retailer, and valuation must be based on other retailers 
 - Analysts has $12 target on the price 
 - 2021 ebda - $330 million, street is at $71 million, Citron expects negative ebda
 	- Target stock price should be at $26 
 - Trading at 40x ebda
	- Apple is trading at 20x 
 - GME is expensive 

4. Know who are on the opposite side of the trade 
 - Something about reddit being geniuses and he needs to get on Tinder 
 
5. Company can become your biggest enemy 
 - $1 Billion in debt 
 - To make an acquisition they will need to sell a lot of stock 
 - Either this company will be JC Penny or Blockbuster";[];wallstreetbets

1. FuNdAmEnTaLs HaVeN't ChAnGeD
2. 1 Billion debt
3. Lowered net income forecast 
4. Know who's on the other side
5. This is going to be like JC Penny with Bill SPACman, ""you can't turn a bad retailer around""

&amp;#x200B;

1. Hmm... 300%+ increase in e-commerce sales + Ryan Cohen? That's a fundamental change from brick and morter bud
2. Lol like we didn't already know this? Store closures, lowered expenses and they already started paying down debt. Fine do a stock offering at some point wipe it clean. 
3. Any analyst can throw out any number, it's an opinion. I expect numbers to be better than expected with the new console cycle, not worse
4. YOU AND MELVIN and neither of you have provided any new insight or information we didn't already know

There are advantages to share capital, it has no interest rate, typically.  Preferred dividends are different story and even then there is no obligation. With debt there is. It is a balancing act. Issuing shares dilutes ownership and value. Generally less debt is better though, however this should not be the way to do it.

We're not squeezing because of valuations or the comparison to a business retailer.  We're squeezing because there are more shorts than shares available.  It is a chance to force a gap up.  A big green dildo the likes of which the market has never seen.

Respectfully, Andrew is right that as a business, we can help GME by going to the store and buying games.  But if we drive the stock prices up as well, they can sell and generate cash to change the business model.  

Andrew is sort of like that guy in the party who would rather look at the room he's in and commenting on why it needs new fresh paint on the walls.  The party can go on and the room's not going to collapse because of the paint.";[];wallstreetbets

2.) Numbers don't lie.  Software Exchange Model not working.  
3.) Valuations matter.  GME not hitting analyst targets at \~$20 value.  
4.) Know whose on the other side of the trade.  Common guy vs professional trader.  
5.) GME could issue more shares and be worst enemy.

1.) He doesn't see it, or doesn't want to see it.

gk3kk8h;keysworld253;;2021-01-21 20:20:42;31;"That was the most superficial DD I have ever heard. It was basically:
1. You can still short the stock. 

Yeah no shit you can still short the stock. Vanguard will be more than happy to loan you shares at 25%. Everytime they loan you shares to short, your firm sells them, vanguard buys them right back and then loans them to you again. 

2. They still have physical locations.

Yeah no shit. That's the whole point of their pivot to E-commerce. The gaming industry will be worth hundreds of billions in 5-10 years. All gamestop needs is 10% of a 500 billion dollar market and boom 50 billion dollar company. 

3. Valuation should be based on brick and mortar.
 
Oh yeah? Well then shouldn't Tesla valuation be based on the fact they sell cars?
Or should Tesla's valuation be based on the fact they will one day in the future sell battery storage products, solar roofs, and hyperloops of whatever the fuck Elon wants? Tesla's valuation is based on the man behind the wheel. Same with GME 

4. Melvin capital is a lot smarter than us.

Yeah ok that's nice. So they are never wrong? They won't be wrong on this? If I had a fucking dollar the boomer hedge funds said ""buy this stock"" or ""sell this stock"" and we're wrong I would have more money to play with than shitron. There is a reason analyst change their ""price targets"" every fucking day. Cause in reality nobody knows fuck shit. 

5. Yeah they already said they will issue more shares. Or do a shelf offering. 

But check this out, they said they would offer 100 million. Well take share price rn. 100 million divided by 40 only equals 2.5 million shares. There is over 70 million shares shorted. You're telling me you'll be able to cover with a skimpy fucking 2.5 million shares?
Also, you think Ryan Cohen accumulated all those shares just for GME to turn around and dilute them? Yeah I doubt that. They see the squeeze coming and will offer a shelf offering when price hits $100. That means they only have to issue a million shares. 

Oh and another thing. Gamestop doesn't have fucking 1 billion in debt. They have less than 500 million in total debt and 25 million in short term. 
What Shitron talking head is referencing is their current liabilities are high at 1.5 billion. Sorry to break it to you but that's the whole point of shutting down 11% of the stores that are unprofitable. They are reducing their lease obligation and they will look to lower their accounts payable. Debt isn't the problem. The brick and mortar stores are bad those are going bye bye.";[];wallstreetbets

There are shareholders that are not part of the public float allowing their shares to be borrowed for shorting.  The most legendary short squeeze of all time - KBIO - happened because of this.  Martin Shkreli was buying shares to reduce the float but allowing borrows against his holdings.  He made some PR announcement along the lines that KBIO was being bought and as people looked to cover their shares there were not enough available in the the public float to do this.;[];stocks

Disagree. Story changed with BoD changes, Ryan Cohen’s letter mentioning current managements failure before the BoD changes, 300% e-commerce growth. Closing down brick and mortar stores that aren’t successful. All this is a change to the story of “Dying mall based B&amp;M retailer.”

2 THE NUMBERS. DOWN 9% YOY

Disagree for things I already mentioned above. Closed 12% of their B&amp;M locations. Up 300% in e-commerce. Bullish 

3 I think his Hedgeye bring up was supposed to be a third point but I don’t know.

If it was, then yeah their analytics and PT aren’t seeing the change in the story just like you. Nice confirmation bias. “They have a low PT and I like them so I’m right.”

Being up 90% in Tesla meant you woke up late. My original purchase of Tesla is up about 1,600%.

No idea anything he says about valuation of Gamestop, but I am going with folks here who actually are a bit closer in age to people who buy games and what potential Gamestop has there then anyone my age (41) let alone someone a few years older has to say about this.

He clearly lacks a deep understanding of Gamestop (as do I) and he thinks you are all garbagemen and pizza delivery boys and therefore clearly incapable of thinking this trough. I think he should listen to what others are waking up to, namely, in the gross stupidity here, there is a collective genius and wisdom that is not quite understood by others.

Hoping you guys are right about Gamestop. I will be fine either way, but I am coming to believe that you are truly onto something. If GME pays off nicely for me based on what I have learned here, I might form a dangerous confirmation bias about what is said here.";[];wallstreetbets

gk3ite3;Regenbooggeit;;2021-01-21 20:07:39;30;"To everyone who’s new here:

GameStop

Trading at just 0.4 times revenue, GameStop (NYSE:GME) is severely undervalued because, well, everyone seems to doubt it -- and not for unjustifiable reasons. In fact, over $1.36 billion of the company's $2.19 billion worth of shares are sold short. Many investors see no reason not to bet against a brick-and-mortar retailer that is still selling physical copies of video games when they are nearly universally available online.

If this is your view, you may be surprised to learn that GameStop is still doing pretty well despite its fair share of challenges. During its nine-week holiday sale ended Jan. 2, the company managed to bring in $1.77 billion in revenue, a modest decline of 3.1% from the same period last year. But in the interim, management closed 11% of its stores for being unprofitable; after adjusting for that, sales for the remaining locations actually went up.

GameStop now has a robust e-commerce segment -- it's growing at a stunning rate of 309% year over year, and it accounts for over a third of total revenue. Last year, management signed an agreement with Microsoft to update its stores with the tech giant's software and cloud data solutions. In return, GameStop will be eligible for a commission on all digital revenue (such as video game purchases) generated from Microsoft's Xbox platform.

Ryan Cohen, a co-founder of online pet food retailer Chewy, joined GameStop's advisory board on Jan. 11. His venture capital firm now owns 13% of the company's outstanding shares.

Given these catalysts, I expect GameStop to turn around its operations in no time. Over the past year, its stock is already up a whopping 683%. Even after an amazing run up, though, its market cap ($2.6 billion) is still less than half its annual revenue ($6.46 billion). That makes for a price-to-sales ratios (P/S) far lower than what most retailers are trading at. If you're looking for stocks with the potential to double over time, consider GameStop.

One could make an argument it’s undervalued and should rise to 120. Fun bonus fact! The real short squeeze hasn’t happened yet. Shorts aren’t covering and they may never. I saw a tweet from some hedge giy saying that a real short squeeze would require &gt;150.

Well if GME rockets to 120 were gonna get tons of FOMO from regular investors especially as this is starting to hit real news outlets.

Shorts are the inverse of a stock purchase. You SELL the share BEFORE you BUY it with the expectation (or gamble) that the price will fall. However, since you just sold a share you didn’t actually own, at some point (per the contract details) you have to actually BUY the share back. If the price of the shares fall like you hope, then you get a return that is the difference between the high price you sold at minus the low price you buy back (and minus the premiums you paid for the initial contract.)

We hate shorters because they are actively “hoping” that a company doesn’t perform well (or  like Shitron 🍋💩and Melvin, manipulating a stock to drop because they were banking on a company failing and it didn’t do they try to sow doubt and artificially drop the price.)

You think my lemonade stand is worth 100$, so you buy a share of my lemonade stand for 100$. But Andrew next door doesn't like sweet lemonade, so he borrows your share and sells it to Melvin, because he thinks he can buy for cheaper later, return it to you and make a profit. Now, lets assume, he really doesn't like sweet lemonade, so he can sell under the price you paid, he can sell for 50, therefore driving my market cap to half as well.  


But there's another phenomenon as well, lets assume Andrew sells at the same price you paid, 100$. Market cap remains the same. But now there are two shares floating around, so if someone wants to buy he can negotiate between you and Melvin because now there are 2 shares, even though one of them is ""synthetic"". So, if there's more offer than demand, price will fall, so even though the intrinsic value of my amazing lemonade stand is the same, the market cap can also go down.  


So, now let's squeeze the things up a little, you realize Melvin has bought a share, so you offer him 120$ for it. Now you have two shares, and say I wont borrow them anymore. But Andrew is still paying interest because he borrowed yours before, and you're the only shareholder now, so you can set up the price at 1000$ and he will eventually have to pay it to give it back to you and ""destroy the synthetic one""....so turns out he got squeezed and you end up with 1 share again and Andrew's wife.

So I immediately lost what little money I had and my ""advisor"" called me and said basically, ""you're an idiot (fair), you don't know what you're doing (also fair), and investing is best left to professionals.

While I doubt shutting down WSB is feasible (considering how many other platforms are out there) I do think we're going to see the rise of more restrictions on individual investors, or RH type platforms getting shut down. I’m on another internet forum of independent individual users throwing money at different things and taking action on different issues and it’s been ugly (I’m a mod on it). We’ve been offered money to become a legitimate entity, and we’ve been threatened to close down because we are causing harm. We've done neither, but our capacity has been reduced as we’ve had to deal with an insane amount of restrictions that make no sense and don’t help anyone – other than keeping the big boys in charge and us out of their way. I think the potential for WSB to influence the way this game is played is huge. I just hope it can persevere.;[];wallstreetbets

Up until Cohen was on board the company was rightfully dying. MMs have been making a killing shorting this for years at this point. Just look at a historical chart. 

The margin call requirements are different for every firm and we have no idea exactly what their liquidity requirements are and what their actual % positions are. If their own liquidity more than covers this shirt position then margin calls aren't a thing. 

Things only get dicey when other big firms get involved and start taking large stakes and actually want their shares delivered. 

So the real answer is nothing. Nothing stops them. They lose a bunch of money but they're large enough that the bleeding is inconvenient while continuing their short thesis. Maybe they scale down along the way, but the short squeeze isn't imminent. Not until other players get involved.

It's why this run up to earnings is insane. Because if they beat earnings and guidance, them the big boys might get involved and THEN we have a ball game

Edit: this is why everyone says buy shares. Because at heart it's a long term value play.

gk3bvjc;itsjern;;2021-01-21 19:15:43;30;"IMO, it's even more specific - it's companies valued like tech that aren't really tech that are overvalued.  Look at the FAANGs, the best examples of true tech companies, which have absurd margins because their costs are so low.  That's what tech is for me - when technology allows scaling beyond other businesses.

Compare Apple with Tesla - Apple's gross margin on an iPhone is 60-70% while Tesla's most popular car, the Model 3, has a gross margin around 10%.  This means Apple is basically printing money with every one of their phones they sell, and can afford to take big risks, try new businesses, etc, while Tesla struggles to break even.  It's not really a fixable problem - it's just a lot cheaper to make a phone compared to what people are willing to pay for it than a car.

The same goes for the other FAANGs - Google, Facebook, Amazon's costs to host pale in comparison to the money they bring in for ads/hosting fees.  Compare that to some of these companies with ridiculous P/E and thin margins - that are valued like the early days of the big tech companies, but without the same scaling advantages.  2 of my go-to examples are Vail Resorts (MTN) and Chipotle (CMG) - each having P/E around 200.  Their costs aren't going to barely increase like tech companies growing with huge revenue increases.  Yes, they can grow a ton, but their margins are never going to be as big as the tech companies they're valued like.";[];investing

gk3btvy;georgeorwell202020;;2021-01-21 19:15:23;14;"&gt;China is finally coming to an end as China and US move towards friendship once again.

China and the USA have never, and will never, be friends. China was the friend of the oligarchs that wanted cheap manufacturing costs. China has gone from 'cheap manufacturer' to 'nearly #1 economy in the world' in the span of 20 - 30 years.

They are increasingly militaristic and assertive in their 'control' ideology (look at Hong Kong, South Pacific Islands, etc). 

**Why should someone be bearish?**

Just look at any asset class, including things like paintings, antiques, etc. They're universally inflated in cost. People are desperate to put their cash into something that has upside value.

When everyone is putting their money everywhere, that signals a massive bubble in nearly every sector. Giving everyone 'free money' that's making &lt; $75,000 year will prop up non-discretionary purchases (consumer staples), but isn't going to prop up the rest of the inflated sectors.

The March 'correction' wasn't a correction. It was a selloff for temporary fear of the virus. This does not count as a 'selloff' in the traditional sense. We recovered far too fast, and will fall far harder in the near future.

**My advice**

Continue contributions to long term retirement funds. Otherwise, keep your powder dry. The greed is off the charts now, and every 23 y/o new graduate feels like Warren Buffet because they haven't lost money yet. **They will lose soon**. Then, we buy.";[];investing

Point to GMEs stock price where it had upwards of 10x+ stock price change in one day? It hasn't happened yet. 

The only people that aren't going to be happy about it are the ones that aren't in on it once the squeeze happens. If the short interest dropped I might agree with you but it only increased. Why else would places that have a history with shorting companies short it so hard now? Look at Citron. They cancelled their livestream for two different reasons and both are complete and utter bull shit. 

Forgot the Biden was getting sworn in? Yeah great excuse. Couldn't have known it was the same day. It has never been on the 20th EVER.

Cancel the next day because of 'technical difficulties' and 'account getting hacked' yet he posted from that account.

It's literally just spreading fear, doubt, and uncertainty and delaying it just makes it even more like that is the reality.

gk3agzv;The_Superfist;;2021-01-21 19:05:09;23;"""Short"" positions bet on price going down.

They borrow a share and sell it.  They get market value and keep the cash, but they owe the broker a share.

When the price goes down, they buy it cheap and hand it back to the broker and pocket the difference.


Example 1 - a clean short trade

So...  Lets say I borrow a screwdriver from you because they're fucking expensive.  I go and sell it because I want money.


A week goes by and christmas is over and all those dads went and returned their screwdrivers and so I buy one on the clearance section and give that one back to you.  I win by keeping the difference and you get your screwdriver.




Example two - whats happening

Let's say i borrowed a shit ton of screwdrivers from you and everyone else in town.  In fact, I borrowed more screwdrivers than are available at the stores.  I sold them and now I'm looking for the clearance sale so I can make bank!


Oh shit, screwdriver prices are going up and I'm responsible for the difference.  I know, I'll tweet about how shitty these screwdrivers are so the price drops and these peasants stop buying them!

The town starts to take notice.  They don't stop buying these screwdrivers because they're good fucking screwdrivers.  They did their own research into these screwdrivers.

Now...  The price is up and the town is lookong at me.  ""Short squeeze time"".  They want their screwdrivers back.  There's not enough in stores and they're flying off the shelves.  The town comes by and takes what screwdrivers I have, but I only have a couple.   So they take the current value of the difference from my piggy bank using whatever price the market is using at that moment for valuation.  I'm forced to eat the loss in the difference.";[];wallstreetbets

Not slightly undervalued company that should be at 20. Fucking rip roaring 200% gains is what people bought into GME for. Just like everything else here. If you want low risk respetable gains truly go somewhere else. You think that people in this sub were all over this thing about 20% gains. You don't know WSB.
People got into GME for 100% gains and thats what they are expecting. Anything else isn't worth the risk. Some people are in here with their life saving sure. Most people in here I would think are taking 10-20% of there savings and going in hard. This is a sub for your absolute most risky investment possible with the biggest payoff.

Edit: Thats why you will always get push back when you start talking about how certain companies are overvalued or are too risky at current price. Most people are aware of that, if you are the 10th bearish GME post, which you easily are, you are just poking the bull.

gk37t8r;psytokine_storm;;2021-01-21 18:45:25;144;"This thing is a **sentiment investor’s wet dream**. 

We’ve got a narrative where small-time retail investors feel that they can be modern-day Robin Hoods. Many have gotten in just in the past 4 days, and have already been battle hardened by **several** 20% intraday dips. That’s a once in a lifetime swing for an index investor. Not for GME gang, though. 

What’s more is that these small-time investors have all been **rewarded** for holding onto this stock. Not only did they all benefit financially from not panic selling in a dip... they’re able to take part in this cultural movement to save a company that for many of them was a beloved childhood fixture. 

As these recent-wave retail investors are rewarded, they are more likely to inform friends about this once in a lifetime play. Most newcomers will make relatively small investments ($500-$10k), but if there are several hundred thousand newcomers in play...

Even BEFORE we consider RC’s plans or the underlying fundamentals, the shorts must be absolutely **pissing themselves** being up against this kind of sentiment.

Maybe GME will fall back to earth, but alot of people here have also taken the position that this is about the little guy against the big MMs. Anyone going against GME on this sub is currently putting down the little guy who has a dream of having a small victory in the market for once rather than just collect the pennies off the ground when the big guys make all the moves.";[];wallstreetbets

That spike and dip today was some MM fuckery going on.

Also have to look into the dark pool prints for this, where a lot of market managers are probably looking to cover their positions.

So yes, there are positions they have to cover, but most likely they will just roll it out over to the next week. Doesnt matter if its expirying today because the can just fail to deliver and cash settle if their broker let's them (which they might).";[];wallstreetbets

gk36ebx;SmugBoxer;;2021-01-21 18:34:57;72;"If I can offer some perspective because I'm bored:

The memes and tribalism is often the way this stuff works in the first place. This is a place where people buy risk for entertainment. The collective must know their marching orders and wsb has found that an easy way to do that is, let me check here....no that can't be right...it says *L. O. T. R. memes*... huh.

In this way, certain members of wsb can call up a banner, a ticker, and unite a following who's willing to split/share the risk pool. We have modern banner lords and their, what are effectively, propagandists or promoters depending on how you view them.

These banner lords form up self organised collectives that are essentially pockets of dissent in the market consensus. And considering a market price is just the current agreed-on price, the fact that we disagree on price is a natural phenomenon.

All of these natural phenomenons give rise to what you see here including varying risk tolerances.

Men used to be asked what exactly they are willing to die for. Their country, their land, their god?

Now u_dfv asks if you're willing to lose your money here and tries to raise an army by convincing them that this might be *the* hill to 'die' on. *It's basically always going to get tribal.*

It eventually caught on when people saw the light and its wild to think about but if they complete the turn around is still sooo undervalued.

The SEC was started by a career insider trader who made his entire fortune doing it, while simultaneously mocking the poors. Every they do is trick to help the big money while fucking us apes over.

They use lies like protect retirement funds, or now that boomers don't matter ""protect the no commission traders"" all to legislate us out of the market like when they added the 25k restrictions to day trading ""to protect retail traders from volatility""

They're doing it again to ""protect options and leveraged traders from volatility.""

We need you to squash this, so knowing it benefits his career to do so he goes on the attack vs WSB. He gets backlash from WSB which he admits is the future so he tries to back away while not pissing off what is likely going to help his future career. By this point shorts realize they are fucked and they pull all help from Cramer and this is the result. He is tired from having to play both sides and losing at both and at the end of the day he is smart enough to respect what we’ve seen and thus wants to cut the bashing. He doesn’t have his short friends anymore because they r fuk and he alienated himself from WSB by trying to defend them. Gg chillman, maybe next time.;[];wallstreetbets

If you don't sell, and you don't set a low limit, you force them into having to cover at higher prices. You will see an insane rally on covers alone, that was what this was all about.

These claims are unsubstantiated, and it certainly just appears that they simply need a new router. It appears that MMs are turning on Melvin as signs of weakness become more apparent. Seeking Alpha, Cramer, and even Motley Fool are starting to believe in the power of unreasonable gambling day traders; however, some of our own ranks are starting to lose hope that the squeeze will ever occur, but the line holds, slowly inching towards victory. Our collective consciousness was both empowered and shaken by a short film starring Joaquin Phoenix showing the despair of an entire generation. How can we lose when we have nothing?

It is not a pump and dump rather it is simply a collective research tool that allows individual investors to connect and share thoughts about a stock that puts them on a more equal footing with the big guys. No one here individually understands a single company or the market that well, but together, the pieces can come together beautifully.

Heck, I am often in the Tesla investor forum and I am long Tesla with a substantial amount of shares and lots of gains there. When I first bought Tesla is was due to belief that they were the future, although I was unsure if they would remain solvent. In any case, long story short, since I joined that sub I have learned more about a company then I ever understood about any business in my life. Every day I find out and can analyze with others any tidbit relating to vehicles or batteries and what it means. I understand very deeply what their opportunities are and what the competition is and hell yeah, I am loooonnng. Mark my words, barring some big upset, Tesla is on pace to being worth $5K-10K per share by 2030. Very few people out there understand their competitive strengths and I grow tired explaining it. It is too hard for people to really think and do the math on what the 4680 structural cells mean. They will find out soon enough. Then of course FSD is a huge deal, but timewise the 4680 structural cell has a much more definite date on the calendar.";[];wallstreetbets

Wednesday is going to be insane. Shitron research is going to do their little circlejerk livestream with the boomers that unironically follow them, trying to drive down the stock price. Just about every fucking short-seller hates us. A multitude of news sites are looking for a scapegoat. We have Cramer the bipolar snake publicly lynching us and then giving us handies five seconds later. The SEC's uptick rule is gone. Shorters are going to throw everything they have at us.

But the stock price keeps rising. We're starting to win. But don't you fucking sell just yet.

But you know what we, the humble degenerates inhabiting WSB will do? Yeah, you fuckin' know. But you're gonna say it with me.

WE WILL💎DIAMOND💎🤚HAND🤚EVERY FUCKING SHARE.

🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

(inserting random rockets to keep your adhd-level attention span)

🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

Remember, ladies and gentlemen, our *defining characteristics* will determine what we are going to do until we see massive fucking gains:

*We are retarded:* we are a sub-20 IQ hivemind that only listens to people who feed their confirmation bias. Don't fucking listen to our brokers or the news. Fuck 'em. Your guy at Fidelity is complaining that you want to buy 10000 GME shares not on margin? Do it. You read something on Barron's about how GME is a shit stock? Fuck 'em. We never listened to anything that didn't have rockets in it, so why start now? That brings us to our next characteristic.

*We are autistic:* We do not, and will not, show any emotion. You're going to pull out because you see a -15% decrease in your overall portfolio? Doesn't matter. The battlegrounds where you bought PLTR calls should have completely desensitized you to any form of loss, and made you a dip-purchasing machine. You should be more concerned about your 100 options contracts that you bought at an uber-retarded strike price expiring than your dad dying, or your wife's boyfriend dying.

🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

(inserting random rockets to keep your adhd-level attention span again)

🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

Last of all, ladies and gentlemen. We are soldiers, fighting corporate America's ""free market"". So, just to spite these greedy little fuckers, I'm changing my limit orders. No $40.69, $69.42, $420.69, or $694.20. We're going to set our limit orders to the fucking 🌑 at $4269.20 *purely* on principle.

The battle is not over. The brave men and women who have taken out money from their mortgage, emptied their savings account, and stole their parents' credit cards have helped us get this far. This is war against Melvin and Shitron, and with leaders like DeepFuckingValue and Ryan Cohen, I refuse to sell. So our battlecry will be: ""I WILL NOT SELL."" *Say it with me.*

*I.*

*Will.*

*Not.*

*Sell.*

That's all. Whenever you see your portfolio heading towards an all-time low, or you see GME going to even 31 per share, repeat the battlecry in your head, or shout it out loud. But if you do, say it with conviction. Let it ring loud and clear for all to hear. I want Gaybriel at Melvin to be able to hear it even when he's giving his wife's boyfriend head.";[];wallstreetbets

One day she came by the house early to drop something off and spotted Jim Cramer on CNBC a couple years after he started hosting *Mad Money*. She started tearing up and I looked at my dad with total confusion. She says, ""remember Jim from college? Look how far he's come."" I was in shock and pressed her about why they broke up thinking I could have had Jim Cramer as a brother-in-law. Turned out he was so worried about people hearing his farts, he used to poop standing up to make sure his farts wouldn't echo off the toilet bowl. One night he drunkenly shit on my sisters jacket that was a WW2 family heirloom. She could never get past it. Anyways, GME to the fucking moon retards";[];wallstreetbets
