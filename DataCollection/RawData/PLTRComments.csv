gr8zg4j;Tookie_Knows;1;"&gt;The caveat is that Palantir's software deployment requires Forward Deployed Engineers (known as FDEs) to work with clients to integrate the software into the client's systems.  Critics of Palantir believe that this reliance on people, means that the product is not easily scalable and that the CEO's growth estimate is too optimistic.  


After spending a few years at a corporation, this argument puzzles me a bit (not arguing against you, just further adding). Every major 3rd party system requires we either pay a consult agency to set up or we hire a bunch of new people to set up and support the product. I'm talking about software like servicenow, PeopleSoft, SAP, salesforce, etc... All these require human capital, no different then what PLTR does. So personally, I fail to see how this is a negative other than scaling. But that's a simple solution, you hire more people.";stocks;2021-03-17 16:00:42

gr8xk8o;DavidAg02;1;"Ok then... let's look at some other signals... 

At the end of Feb., 3 PLTR executives sold 2.7 million shares. Ask yourself... why would they do that? Yes, the are probably mostly paid in stock, but which situation is more likely? All 3 executives needed the money right then and there OR All 3 executives believed that's the highest price they would be able to get for a very long time? 

Also... a quote directly from Karp in this interview: ""We‚Äôre in this for the long haul. If you are speculating or you‚Äôre thinking about this short-term, there are plenty of other things to invest in. If you want something else, it‚Äôs a huge world. Buy some other stock. You don‚Äôt have to buy Palantir. No one is forcing you.‚Äù

The CEO is practically saying ""Don't expect the stock price go anywhere anytime soon."" What does he mean by long haul? 5 years? 10 years? 20 years? Who the hell knows. Either way, it's a signal to me that the company leadership does not expect their stock to perform at or above market levels anytime soon.";stocks;2021-03-17 15:46:49

Check optionsprofitcalculator.com to see if at that price target on that date your proftis would be greater than what they are now. Then re-evaluate what you really believe the stock‚Äôs price movement is going to be like and weight the risk/benefit of keeping it.

If the stock shot up quickly and you think it could either trade sideways or go down before exp, then it might be a good idea just to sell the option now because theta will chip away at the option‚Äôs value as time goes on.

I have a 20$ call option on PLTR expiring next June. I plan on holding it until then because if PLTR were 20$ right now, I‚Äôd buy 100 shares at that price in a heartbeat. 

On the other hand, when PLTR was 22$ I had bough an April 28$ call. When PLTR shot up to 26 over a few days I sold it because not only would I rather buy shares at 25$ (which I expected it would get back down to), but also because steep price movements either way have a greater impact faster on price movement and I didn‚Äôt expect with enough faith that it would continue to rise at that rate and to that price point.

Their biggest customer is the government. Our government is up to it's eyeballs in debt and constantly under pressure to reduce costs. Their business opportunities in the private sector are almost purely speculative at this point with no hard data on contract amounts, length of contract, services to be provided, etc.

Also, their platform development plan (what they do with their software in the future... what they are working on) is practically non-existent. 99% of the time, in the software world, this means that they have no real plan. If you have a great plan on where your software is going, you talk about it. You brag about it. You give your customers confidence that the things they want the software to do are being worked on or are at least planned for. PLTR does not have this. Those are the reasons I'm not in it.

Also, their platform development plan (what they do with their software in the future... what they are working on) is practically non-existent. 99% of the time, in the software world, this means that they have no real plan.

-If we are forming an uptrend channel we should bounce off 23-24 (fib retracement is around 23.80 I believe).

-We retest 20-22 and double bottom

-We go sub 20. 

My bet is we don't make a double bottom but instead a cup and handle, bouncing off 23-24 range this week and uppies for next week.

gr89ae2;ReflectAA;1;"If you don‚Äôt need the money then don‚Äôt panic sell anything. The first rule about the stock market is to not panic or be reactive. And stop fucking with options until you really understand the market. Fascinating that you say you have no clue where the market will go short term, but yet options are entirely dependent on that knowledge and you bought them anyway. You gotta be a little more disciplined than this. 

Personally I go out of my way to avoid over-expensive companies with so much downside like PLTR and most green energy, in order to avoid this very scenario. so I can‚Äôt really give advice on your choices. But if you insist on sticking with these picks the first thing I would do in approx 4 weeks is buy more of the long term options over the next few months to stop those from drowning. In 5 years your stocks will probably recover but your options will not exist. So those losses are more urgent

This is assuming you still believe in these two companies. I am not telling you that you should or should not.

Either way, the macro-economic environment is going to be harsh for these two companies for a while. You can probably expect more losses.";stocks;2021-03-17 12:15:20

gr7z31y;filmmakerwannabe92;1;"This is absolutely a guess, I have no knowledge of the subject, but I'd say that they might have chosen PLTR over AWS or Azure due to antitrust issues with Amazon and Microsoft as well. 

Amazon, Google, Microsoft, Facebook are on the knife's edge right now (as in, the last and next couple of years). People are worried about their personal data, there is tons of scandals with how they use it to influence people, and these giants being too big and too powerful are something that (at least publically), both left and right seem to agree. I think everyone knows that they will not be allowed to operate as they do now forever, so I'd guess 'the government would try to avoid being dependent on them as well. 

(For the record, I'm not naive, I am pretty sure that the government will not ""save the people"" from this. They probably have most politicians in their pocket on both ends of the spectrum, to some degree, and politicians love what tech can do for them, so I doubt they will put a *real* stop to it. But at least publically, there is scrutiny, and likely, there will be changes on how they can/will operate).";stocks;2021-03-17 09:47:56

Bond yields are rising because of a growing economy and market. Low rates will continue to prevail."" Maybe he'll throw a bone to investors with something like ""while we do not see cause for concern over near-term inflation, we will monitor it closely and have the tools to address it if the need arises"". Of course, the tool would be an early rate hike, which would cause the markets to puke just as much as concerns over inflation.

Idk man, I'm an optimist but if tomorrow is flat, I think that's a win. I expect some panic selling, that's for sure.

The flip side is that a growing real economy is good for the market in the aggregate (if hyper speculative tech pulls back, maybe don't have 80% of your portfolio in PLTR, ARKK, and meme junk bought at ATHs). VIX is falling as well. It's like the market wants to continue this bull run, but isn't ready to actually do it. There's a disturbance in the force.

Yield raises = market throws a tantrum Real/perceived inflation = market throws a tantrum Perceived early rate hike = market throws a tantrum

The company does not provide great earnings, they over emphasize on their growth percentage when it was almost all government contract and barely any commercial.  My issue with the stock is that the valuation of a company that provides such mediocre results at 40b means they have to execute perfectly just to avoid a drop in price. I don't want to pay such a premium for the hype. They could have a great product, but execution of sales and revenue is what makes the return on investment. You hear all the shareholders pitch how they're not a new company just because they're new to the market.  This leads me to a larger concern to why I should expect them to get it together in the next 10 years when they haven't in the previous 20.

All that doesn't really matter on here though because the pltr  bulls love to cover their ears to any bear case. They downvote anyone with an opposing view,  so all you'll see is the great hype posts.  This will cost retail investors money as they're drawn in and will buy at any price because there's no skepticism on the current valuation. I would buy pltr, but not anywhere over 25b figuring in the current partnerships (and thats still a risky price based on revenue.) No one can seem to give a projection to how much revenue each blue chip deal is in dollars and cents for annual earnings at the end if the day, they just hear the names and scream buy. Math out a generous stream of income just from those deals and you still wont be talking 2x their current revenue which even at a generous multiplier puts 40b high.";stocks;2021-03-17 06:13:11

gr7gccz;Ok_Kangaroo55;1;"Fellow PLTR bagholder. I love the stock but claiming they are 5 years ahead is complete BS, so is the Pollyannish goal of ""avoiding"" conflict. We maintain power by superior tech, weaponry, and bombing the fuk out of people.";wallstreetbets;2021-03-17 04:55:03
gr7fg8k;Chrononubz;5;"I'm going to post this here for visibility.  I've tried everything to get this approved.  No hate on the mods.  Thoughts?

Karp's interview is being overblown.  The headlines are clickbait.  He talks America needing software(pure software/AI) that is the best to AVOID conflict in order to stay ahead of America's adversaries. Basically he's claiming Palantir Technologies to be S class disruptive Tech that can lead future innovations for America.

Karp would rather put his focus on having the company put its ""best foot forward"" for the sake of protecting America and its private and public interests.

He was asked in the middle of the interview ""How would he entice new commercial customers?""

He then starts talking about the how Foundry and Gotham are unique technically speaking ( claims his tech is 5 years ahead of everyone else low key), and the way they do business is unique.  For example he explains that Palantir  in the commercial space, Foundry is a Finished product as opposed to other ERP systems that require you to do an entire IT installation that can take months.  Foundry can be installed as a whole stack in a few days!  That difference is how Karp and Palantir thinks Software companies will sell their products.  He mentions that typically ERP systems entice customers with Jargon that promises to deliver instead of providing a product that stands out from the rest.  He truly believes Palantir is in a class of its own.   He actually believes despite having Elite tech that he provides for the biggest companies in the word, he thinks that Palantir can provide a ton of value to smaller to medium companies by offering superior ERP Software transforming their business to save them millions of dollars.

They talk little bit about PLTRs partnerships including 3M, BP, IBM, and AWS.  They talk about how IBM and AWS were thought to be rival companies to Palantir but instead decided to join forces because those companies understand how difficult it is to build what Palantir built with Foundry and Gotham.

HE LIKES THE RETAIL INVESTORS, he HATES the ""INVESTORS"" who buy and sell the stock who don't have any clue about the company or its Tech.

He can't on camera ""PUMP"" the stock, so he just talks about how he's more focused on building the Company for the long-term.

TLDR

So about a fucking hour talking about how superior the tech( Foundry/Gotham) is compared to any other software company's tech and how Karps ideological view of supporting America and its western values by providing Superiority and Complexity in order to stay ahead of its adversaries.

Foundry is 5 years ahead of any other ERP software in the market.  IBM and AWS bow down to PLTR.

Intrigued yet?

What you can do though is buy a call. This gives you the ability to exercise on someone else. Say you buy a PLTR 30c 3/19 for $0.05 - a contract that costs you 0.05x100 = $5 &lt;---Very cheap. - you buy this because you think pltr will go up higher than $30 per share before friday.

So tomorrow JDog gives his speech and talks about how the fed is going to use PLTR software and that it's the tits. This sends PLTR up to $33 a share 2 days before your contract expires. Now you see that the market is willing to pay $300 for your contract because you could just exercise for $30 a share and immediately sell the shares for $33. But you're poor and can't afford to exercise, so you just sell the contract to someone else for $300 and make yourself a profit of $295 after subtracting the $5 you originally paid.

If raw data were coal and most people were just burning it in stoves, PLTR would be a guy coming around selling steam engines and their maintenance.

Y'all say SI is maybe up to 900% and they say it's down to 27%. Hell, they even testified to congress that they covered.

We've seen some big gains but that seems to be mostly due to whales and other HF and today the price dropped way down to 179. Their goals are clearly not ours. Its just too much risk for me when I've already lost 20k on bb and pltr and nok.

If I get knocked down to zero it's going my to be too hard to climb back up. 20k is probably nothing to many of you

I would focus on saving an emergency fund before investing anything. Its better to be safe with that first 10k or so in case you do ever need it for something important and unpredictable. Then you don't have to sell any of your holdings to pay for that event.

Then throw your extra money after that into SPY, VTI or another index fund and just add to it consistantly. With what seems like a huge workload its very unlikely you'll be able to effectively monitor the market to more actively trade. 

If you try to Meme-Stock your way to a 400% gain, it's much more likely you'll lose 50% instead, and then you're in an even worse position. Especially if you can't monitor it 24/7 to avoid any large drops.

gr4qi7e;TrickyCompetition876;0;"I'm not a professional advisor or analyst, but I'm astonished with the share price suppression that seems to be going on with Palantir (PLTR) lately.  I have not done a deep analysis in competition, but one example is Alteryx.  

Alteryx also provides products for software analytics and data science.  They appear to have had $495m in revenues in 2020.  The share price has been ""hammered"" by the tech sell down but still hovers around $90.  And that's approximately $50 discounted off the 1 year target price of $145.

By comparison, PLTR is stuck at $26.50ish with a target of $26 (target info from Yahoo!Finance).  PLTR had over $1b in revenues in 2020.  They have government and commercial sides to their business.  They signed new contracts recently.  

Hello??? How in the world does a company with more than 2x the revenues of a competitor trade for a quarter of the price?  Quick searches suggest this is a similar story looking at other big data firms.

In my humble opinion, PLTR is on a big sale right now.  Long shares and calls.";investing;2021-03-16 15:24:49

I got my first job and I intend to invest my salary right away. This is my plan for investment every month:

-	30% on $INRG (iShares Global Clean Energy)
-	30% on $IITU (iShares S&amp;P 500 Information Technology)
-	30% on $VUSA (Vanguard S&amp;P 500 ETF)
-	10% on risky, single stock investments like $NET and $PLTR

The goal is to one day be able to use the earnings to purchase a nice house and land. Until that day comes, I only plan to purchase positions, with no liquidation whatsoever, especially since selling would mean paying taxes.

But valuations of desirable companies can stay stretched for a very long time, while valuations of undesirable companies can stay depressed for a very long time. 

Also, it's questionable how stretched valuations actually are with rates this low and monetary stimulus of this amount. Which is one reason why I think they continue to run for a bit longer. 

After that, and you start to see the effects of efficiencies created from increased technological adoption from the crash course all the ancient companies just received, mrna applications and gene editing to cure and treat disease, legitimate AI applications that allow next level ability of planning and predictability (like what PLTR is doing), autonomous driving, etc (I've heard things like no-code software, synthetic biology and ambient computing thrown around but don't know much about them). Right now we're getting to see the impact of all the future technological promise from previous decades (but maybe this is a sell the news moment for some?).

gr0hvyl;Ethos_Logos;1;"I‚Äôve done a decent amount of research I hope to give some insight - I‚Äôll paraphrase how it was explained to me.

If you give a kid an instrument (say, a recorder flute) they‚Äôve never played before, they may be able to, after some time play hot cross buns, or three blind mice. But maybe their progress isn‚Äôt fast enough, or they get impatient and don‚Äôt see the point of continuing to practice with no discernible improvement, after a while.

If you give a kid that same recorder, but also music lessons with a good tutor for a year, they‚Äôll become better at using that instrument than they otherwise would have. They‚Äôll keep getting better until they reach their potential under the guidance of the tutor. After a year or so, the tutor leaves, but the kid still knows how to play the instrument fairly well. And the kid knows he can call the tutor to help him learn a new instrument if he desires to (like if a company used PLTR to better their logistics, and then decided to use it to monitor theft in their loss prevention dept).

So with the temporary cost of the engineer (this cost goes away once the client is set up = about a year), the client sees a good ROI. Happy clients renew/increase contracts and refer other clients. 

Opposite that, is that if there was no FDE, the client may not get the functionality of Foundry; like using the handle end of a spoon to eat soup. It‚Äôs the right tool used incorrectly. Clients wouldn‚Äôt see the value in signing with them, and a meh reputation would kill any chance of commercial success. 

So while the first year of a contract may not be profitable due to the FDE combined with the lower introductory rate, imagine the mess and expenses of ‚Äúgoing back to the old way‚Äù for the client.";investing;2021-03-15 14:09:04

With these I‚Äôve been able to get min returns of 10-15 percent every year. It‚Äôs a diversified portfolio with many sectors so if one collapses you aren‚Äôt totally fucked. Don‚Äôt have more than 10% in any of these and you‚Äôll be fine long term.

Final price of advice is the same as the first. Do not gamble on meme stocks. It‚Äôs tempting, but like a siren song, you will most likely find yourself shipwrecked amongst the rocks.";stocks;2021-03-14 17:25:33

The more research I put into GME (and my other high conviction bet PLTR) the more confident I am in my position. I rode GME originally from $20 thru Jan, doubled down @ \~$45 and rode it back up to $200, exited position to put profits into PLTR, and bought back in at $141 and keep building.

gqwjkyv;SkeezixMcJohnsonson;1;"You will only receive a small percentage of what you paid for the shares, depending on strike price and expiration date, when you sell the options. Example, PLTR is currently trading around $27, so you would have to borrow $27 per share (minimum 100 shares) on margin to buy the stock. Then say you want to sell a covered call option that expires this coming January. If you think the stock will double in that time period you might choose to sell the $50 options. Those will get you a premium of $4.40 per share. If the stock remains below $54.40 on the option expiration date you keep the premium and you still own the stock. If it finishes above that you keep the premium, and you get the profits between $27 and $54.40 per share.

How many different wallstreetbet wanna be subs are you a member of.  Posted any of those big PLTR gains to inspire others to follow in your footsteps so that they can be like you?  Just a glance at your history makes me think PLTR is the only stock out there that makes money.  Would there be any comments begging the GME/AMC crowd to bring those gains over your way?

gqugxke;stopearthmachine;1;"No I don't find that very odd tbh. Most subreddits with more than 5mil people have a dense bot structure to keep spam out and will inadvertently catch posts in favor of being hard on spam and overly cautious since hundreds of people are posting every minute trying to get posts on the sub. If they're organizing pump and dumps, tell me what they're pumping? Can you show proof of specifics accounts that are being ""allowed"" to post or that DD for various tickers that are currently on their ""hot DD"" list are P&amp;Ds?

Here are the top ""DD"" posts from the past 24 hours on WSB: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/search/?q=flair%3ADD&amp;sort=top&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;t=day

Here we see GME (obviously given its topical relevance), QFIN, HRB, DKNG, PYR, SKLZ, DASH, PLTR, XL, CLF, STAR, and the list goes on the further you scroll. If there is a pump and dump being organized by the mods, surely you can't pin that on GME which became a worldwide #1 topic and is obviously going to be the most talked about ticker not only on WSB but also on most every other stock related subreddit / website.

Sounds like you just think it's a conspiracy that you had a post removed on a huge subreddit, but go try to get a post going on any other subreddit with over 5 million subs and you'll most likely succumb to a similar fate of either having your post removed for non-transparent reasons or instantly buried.";StockMarket;2021-03-13 23:19:00

He does lose money as if PLTR were to hit $100 for example he would miss out on actually owning PLTR and the potential premium as he sold the Calls when PLTR was at $25.

Which is why most people only sell CC at a relative peak in a stock price then ride the dip and close the contract.

gqubb7p;Replybot5000;1;"I'm on my phone so I'll go through each one, two at a time if that's ok.

1) If it's an old company it turns a profit or at least has for a sustained period.
2) It could have been getting shorted from that time, but if I'm not mistaken it was comfortably above $10 for a decent while and then the price started to drop, nothing else massvely changed to warrant that imo. 
3) It certainly shouldn't drop the price.
4) It could have been shorted since then, and because it's profitable it didn't go under...tbf it's a mystery to me because nothing major happened that year to warrant the drop. Tin hat for me there I guess.
5) It gets enough shine to do well recently which is nice and I earned a little profit already which I'm too stupid to cash in on.
6) Cinema + Girlfriend was the crux of my point there. Historically good things happen there.
7) We're now 1-1 for tin hat theories! But seriously, the entry rate is low and affordable for those who don't have the initial funds to drop into GME and Two meme stonks isn't too much imo.
First I seen of GME it was a sign that made the front page of Reddit saying GME/AMC GO BRRR. And it caught my attention..Do if it was a diversion it worked to opposite for me because I now have shares in both.
8) We're good.
9) I personally consider cinemas to be a relavtively safe bet but personall preference there.
10) I agree, You could be right about PLTR, I like RKT myself too because they are a genuinely successful company also.
So shares in AMC, PLTR, RKT, and GME is not a bad ""bet"" imo and I don't think any is a distraction from the other because everyone knows them at this point.

gqu8l2v;ggiziwegotthis;1;"1. You are half correct, it sure is old but profitable is a strecth - yes they did have 2017 recently but other than that i'd say noees. 
2. No it has not, at the very least not on paper, 5 weeks total of 1 year has it been a ""10$ stock"" AMC has also been falling and failing since 2016. 
3. That might be true but what you need to take into consideration is the immensley huge volume AMC has - that short interest can be covered in a single day without even raising the avg. volume. 
4. It is a reasonable assumtion to assume AMC fell due to covid and I agree when we see Hollywood release all their movies as Covid is gone we should see a bump  in AMC. But I woul also like to point out AMC has been on a downward trajectory since 2016 - was covid a kick in the face: sure as fuck but AMC was still laying on the ground already. 
5. Can't answer this I have no idea and I guess it depends on whom you ask. 
6. It probably was and who could blame you? not like you had a flat TV in your room connected to the entire world when you were younger. hmms... we do have.... that right now yes? 
7. It sure is, I ask my self daily why... All I think is it was pushed by bots to drive money away from GME. I have zero proof of this but I fully believe it. 
8. I like it, no answer other than that. 
9. I think it could pay well when and if they and hollywood open fully, I've been contemplating holding over a few Q-reports but no longer than 2021, srsly no innovation left but they could make a nice chunk of profit this year with the above two conditions being met that is.

Or you know that the stock won‚Äôt hit $65 and instead will dip so you can relax with theta decay.

If PLTR hits $65 he is now at risk of someone exercising the contract and having his shares called away, meaning he would miss on much more profit as PLTR rises in profit because he gave his shares away.

gqscrvs;SpiritofInvictus;1;How do you actually set a good entry price? What metrics do you use to determine that point? Take $PLTR for example (aside from all the meming). How would you determine when to enter that stock if you believe in the product? Is it a question of technical analysis once fundamentals have established the company as potentially beneficial?;stocks;2021-03-13 10:22:29

gqqdkgr;moolium;1;"I'll start by saying I wouldn't invest in EA right now,  I think as software in this valuation range,  ADSK has the brightest future for increased growth. I think PLTR is expensive right now myself too,  and they're about the same as RBLX. Id probably still buy PLTR first. 

I see at that everyone investing buys thinking that the company is going to make a lot more money. The question is, are they going to make enough money in the future to validate their value? How much money do they need to make to increase the value?  Where will they be in 10 years? If roblox takes 10 years to do 6 billion in a year,  are they still going to be worth 40 billion like EA? I don't know based on their guidance that they will be there any time in the next 5 years.  Is this going to tie up my money at this crazy premium? The clientele are children.  If we compare to platforms,  Twitter has a ton of users,  but hasn't traditionally been able to monetize well.....I guess where I'm going with all of this,  I love doing comparison shopping.  If something is going to tie up my money and the upside within the next decade is already priced in,  I can likely find something trading cheaper.

gqqbwfa;ionized_fallout;-2;"03:47 PM EST, 03/12/2021 (MT Newswires) -- AMC Entertainment Holdings(AMC) was the most active among the most cited stocks on Reddit's wallstreetbets on Friday, with shares jumping 9% in afternoon trading on slightly lower volume.

The movie theater company, which has been under considerable financial pressure during the pandemic, released better-than-expected quarterly earnings on Wednesday. AMC also revealed it has now reopened 527 of its 589 US theaters.

Shares of GameStop(GME) , which has served as the center of the wallstreetbest universe for the last several weeks, were up 6% in late day trading on slightly lower volume.

Palantir (PLTR) , which has also been in play for some time on the subreddit, was trading largely flat. Volume was down from 86 million shares on Thursday to 50 million on Friday.

Forum regular Tesla (TSLA) saw its shares slip 2%, while BlackBerry (BB) shares climbed 9%.

Cannabis producer Aphria(APHA) was also back on Reddit radar screens Friday, with shares gaining 3%. Also attracting attention was Chinese EV maker Nio (NIO), with shares dipping 2%.

Elsewhere in the broader market, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 1% and the Nasdaq Composite Index eased 0.6%, while the S&amp;P 500 hugged the flatline.

gqopc5p;notpr1m;1;"Agree with all of this (with the exception of the TSLA shade because all of that speculation is very, very real and I do believe that legacy automakers and utility companies had better prepare for battle‚Äîbut I digress). 

This is very much a bull market and a lot of it is driven by new participants but also disruptive companies like a TSLA or PLTR or DKNG that have young investors genuinely excited. Even GameStop‚ÄîI came for the squeeze‚Äîbut I‚Äôve stayed because I‚Äôm a gamer and I know there‚Äôs a vacuum between the massive ecosystem of gamers and streamers and the mainstream that needs to be filled and I know RC sits on their board and I saw what he did with Chewy. Sure, could be too little too late, but why not take a flyer on it? If nothing else, the fundamental forces at play for GME have inspired me to begin looking at another company rumored to be aggressively going digital now, and I can think of other real-time case studies that my friends and I are all considering when deciding to buy shares in a company. 

The beauty of this market is that information is plentiful and there are still plenty of safe companies out there with strong dividends that can be used to backstop a portfolio so we can feel comfortable betting on the riskier plays. There are plenty of value traps, sure, but also plenty of no brainers to balance it out.

&gt;I want to own Palantir (PLTR) at $23.5, it is currently trading at $26. My assumption is that I can sell the put option (sell to open) contract for a strike price of $23.5 for whatever date I choose (looking short term just to start off - say April 1). If the price of PLTR drops to $23.5 at any point during that period and gets executed, I am assigned the shares at the strike price of $23.5 (minus the premium I receive so actually less than $23.5 overall). If it never hits the strike price of $23.5, the contract expires I get no shares but I collect the premium.

What is the difference between this and setting up a market limit for $23.5?";stocks;2021-03-12 07:20:04

gqnxpvz;Old_fart5070;1;"Kinda. The requirement for your desire of owning PLTR at 23.5 is that the stock sinks to that level or lower on expiration, so that you would be assigned and the buyer of your contract could exercise their ride to put the stock to you for 23.5. If neither condition is fulfilled (both the stock at or under 23.5 and the time an expiration date), then all you would have is a short put contract and the premium you got for it.
The gotcha selling CSPs is if the stock plummets: you would find yourself short a deeply ITM contract and you would buy the stock at a price much higher than market. You could lessen your losses wheeling your way out of the hole (see r/thetagang) but it may take months if at all possible (see NKLA).";stocks;2021-03-12 06:23:03

gqnvq6q;hendrix_srv;1;"PLTR vs SNOW.  

PLTR: Both my brokerage and CFRA stock report show only the last two quarters of financial data for PLTR.  Both also show yearly data for 2018-2020, which shows CARGR (compound annual revenue growth rate) of \~35%.   Even 35% is great!  But the lack of quarterly data is a unusual.  Where is the audited quarterly data?   

Despite the question marks about it's past, analysts are enthusiastic about it's future, forecasting 76% annual revenue growth over two years, which is absolutely astounding.

SNOW: all sources show a full set of 12 quarters of data for SNOW.  I presume these are audited financial results.  Squishy maybe, but not too soft.  Unlike PLTR's apparently unaudited 35% over last two years, SNOW's presumably audited growth rate is a whopping 138% over two years.  

Analysts are also enthusiastic about SNOW's future, forecasting 74% annual revenue growth over two years, which is absolutely astounding.

So the purported future is the same for both companies (76% vs 74% revenue growth), yet PLTR is trading at 40x TTM Rev and SNOW is trading at 108x TTM Rev.  Here's why:

ONE: PLTR slipped in sneaky guidance below estimates at last earnings announcement. 

TWO: it was supposed that PLTR would break out of the government sector and into the private sector after going public, but there's scant evidence of that in the most recent earnings report.  That calls some doubt on  the 76% growth forecast.  

THREE: PLTR's historic revenue growth is much lower than SNOW.  The forecast of 76% isn't reflected in it's historical data, so it's less believable.  

FOUR: PLTR's historic financial data isn't...all there...or something, so no doubt that's throwing cold water on the value.";investing;2021-03-12 05:57:46

gqmyxz3;JonDum;1;"No no no you have it completely wrong. If you are trying to sell a put to open a long position ""sell to open"" you *don't* make the strike what you want to buy it at ($23.5). You may not ever get exercised if it remains above that. Not to mention if it does fall that low you would have made more selling the put at that point in time instead of now and you'll lose out on any rebounds.

You must find a strike price where the premium minus the strike equals the price you want to enter at. Generally this will be ATM or even a little higher.

For example let's say PLTR is trading at $26 and an atm strike is $2.50. Come expiration PLTR is $25.50 and you get assigned. You then must purchase $2600 worth of shares but you keep the $2.50x100 premium which brings your *effective* cost basis of your new long position... $23.50.";stocks;2021-03-12 00:43:43

gqmqwiz;WebMasterQ;1;"Remember buying a call option gives you the right but not the obligation to purchase the underlying stock. You can simply sell-to-close the contract (provided there's a market for your option) or let expire. The contracts themselves fluctuate in price similar to the stock but with a few other variables in the equation. 

For example if I buy 5 calls of $pltr for strike price of $26 with expiration of 4/1 for a premium of $2.60 the 5 contracts  cost $1300 (5x100x$2.6). Now $pltr goes up to $28 per share and the option premium might* now be $3.75. So now your 5 contracts are now worth a total of $1875. You can sell the 5 contracts for a profit of $575. 

This is the ""simple"" explanation. There's a whole lot of math and other variables that go into the pricing of the options. I'm just starting learn the math portion.";investing;2021-03-11 23:33:18

Standard disclaimer, not financial advice, your money, your responsibility.

I've been in the big corporate data space for the last 11 years advising companies to adopt the architecture PLTR has delivered.  Theses folks are so far ahead of other vendors.  They correctly assert their competition is in house teams.  I can tell you from experience, most big company tech developers are fairly mediocre and risk averse.  

There are stories that PLTR software was used to find Bin Laden.  I don't know if that is true but it is likely.  I am pretty sure that the basic research for this came from the 911 retrospective.  Various agencies had parts of the picture before the attack but we not able to ""connect the dots"".  This lead to massive funding for graph databases with formal semantics and inferencing.  

If you watched the demo, they explained that the core of the system is a formal, well managed, evolving ontology.  The data is mapped to this standardized definition of meaning and relationships.  That makes it much easier to combine data from many different sources and then apply the analytic layer with ML and visualizations.

The key result is this platform empowers organizations to execute is hours or a few days.  That was clearly the kind of requirement the DOD and other TLA agencies demanded.  So the value proposition is speed and flexibility.  Could a company build similar solutions in house? Maybe but it might take years.

The final thing that sealed my decision, PLTR has a track record of executing on the business and services side.

Net Loss looks bad, at (1,166,391), but much of their Cost of Revenue and Operating Expenses are stated to be stock-based compensation (SBC) expense, which totals 1,270,702, which is 56.07% of their 2,266,352 overall expenses \[Cost of Revenue 352,547 + Total operating expenses 1,913,805\]

Loss from Operations is (1,173,679)

Add back in total SBC of 1,270,702

= 97,023

When factoring in the smaller line items like interest income/expense and tax expense/benefits, it looks like Palantir made roughly 100MM excluding SBC.

The path to profitability is high growth rate that exceeds expense growth rate, but it's not clear.

If Palantir's revenue grows around 35%/year over the next 5 years, they are looking at revenues of 5 Billion... so the question then becomes: how fast will their overall expenses be growing?

I don't have an answer to this.

The Bull case is that Palantir continues to streamline product deployment through modular software and automation of their platform.  The Bear case is that every customer's needs are going to continue to be different, which hinders scalability because the company needs to keep growing its staff of FDEs (Forward Deployed Engineers).

An investment in PLTR is betting that the company will be able to solve the scalability problem, assuming that they also provide a better product than their competitors.";investing;2021-03-11 22:57:02

gqmau74;holengchai;1;"From another post:

 

Not financial advice.

&gt;You need to be careful:  
$45 is 30x revenue (this is higher than TSLA, SNOW, PLTR valuation).  
They were priced at $8bn in Nov, now $30bn mkt caps?  
They sold $520m of series H funding or 12m shares in Jan 2021 so that they did not need to do the IPO's ""offering"" and go direct. What this means is they convinced &lt; 10 investors to pony up the funds for 12m shares at $45 that they can tell you the entire 652 million shares is all worth $45 also.With the IPO route, the bankers would have priced it at $15 and it doubles like AI, ABNB, DASH, so it'd be $30. But they are smart to tell you that it's worth $45, hoping you will pay $70/$80/$90. And if that happens, this stock will be more expensive than any stocks I know.  
Also, why Direct Listing? Because there will not be a lock up period of 180 days. Without it the investors can sell on day 1. But why does it matter? Because after covid, kids will go to school, spend time at pool parties, soccer games than playing. Guess what would happen to earnings and then stock price?  
What they did was brilliant. They did an IPO without and IPO. They got the IPO money with series H funding, then the DPO allowed them to sell on day 1 (using 12/652m shares or 1.8% of shares to pump the value of the company by 300%). They got a sky-high valuation, more than TSLA could. And in their words, they saved $1bn of banker fees. The only losers? I think maybe those who buy from their selling out.

No no no.

The 2239 loss is the loss for owning an equity worth zero that you paid 2350 for, taking into account the 111 you made on premium.

Lets say on the exercise date, PLTR is at a price of 16 due to some unforeseen circumstance. Your loss would be (2350-1600+111) or 639 dollars.";stocks;2021-03-11 19:03:05

gqkzmo0;JediAreTakingOver;0;"With respect, no it does not need to profit quickly. Potential is baked into the stock price, as is demand for the stock.

PLTR could fly based on total rumours ""buy the rumour"". As long as investors are demanding the stock and continually invest in a belief of future profits, the stock can fly.

Fundamentals are not the only indicator of the stocks price. PLTR could spend 5 years in a demand bubble. Tesla has been in a demand bubble since before COVID. Its driven on rumour and potential rather than fundamentals.

2001 Dot Com bubble was this, but on a massive scale.";investing;2021-03-11 15:41:51

Personally I think you have way too many similar funds with overlap and your individual stocks are not distinct enough from the ETFs you hold. 

Very underweight international/EM, energy, US financials which all have the ability to seriously outperform tech this year if the reopening rotation keeps happening. 

Have you used a portfolio x ray tool that shows the weight of your individual holdings? That would be a good step to take.";investing;2021-03-11 14:59:20

Remember the competition for facebook? Google and yahoo tried everything possible to get into and establish in their space but failed and fb with it's way of spread across age barrier established itself.

So just by saying hey others did not compete with others so they won't compete with pltr is not a valid argument

Biggest data holder is google and facebook if this particular field becomes lucrative they won't stay put they will try to get a market share on this one. 

So I am asking the same question again what is the pltr advantage over other and why won't competition take away market share pltr holds ?

lol that feels like a lot when a ton of your holdings are kinda meme tech stocks. (not meme in a bad way, just very popular among reddit).

ark, icln (ouch), tsla, pltr,nio, dkng, crsr, fb, aapl are all meme to some extent... hell that's all your holdings actually.

not saying the blue chip memes are bad. they're not. dis/fb/aapl are probably your safest bets of all the holding. but whats the point of holding in ARKK when you have PLTR, DKDNG, TSLA and AAPL? 

If you want to diversify your account, there's no reason to have ETFs that overlaps all your other holdings.";stocks;2021-03-11 07:31:56

gqjid5f;rockin-robby;7;"The largest problem with your model is the gross margin assumption being far off. Palantir is aiming for 85%+ gross margins. They were talking about that on investor day. 

As for the price / sales your assumption is also low. It is not the case that a company growing this fast with this kind of margin gets a 20 PS. You should be thinking more like Shopify (SHOP). Companies that get low PS in software are mature like Google or FB. But they don‚Äôt have that kind of growth. You are showing a measly $7bn revenue which is a paltry portion of their TAM. 

You also should consider for pricing in long term growth the TAM will greatly increase. They are underpricing their product to gain monopoly power. They are seeking a technical monopoly as they are too far ahead, also to discourage new entrants right now with low pricing, and to ward off any anti trust pressure via low pricing. This will get them monopoly status and pricing power. Also data collection is always increasing at a fast pace. I‚Äôve seen TAM estimated at double that in five years. 

Based on these factors I‚Äôm seeing PLTR as positioned to be gigantic. Karp talks about it being the most important software company in the world in time and he is right. No business can compete and no government without an edge in data analysis and AI.

gqjfvt3;_RayDiggs_;2;I bought 120 $GME @ 212 in Jan. A few weeks ago I sold a 3/12 C 225 to buy $PLTR calls. Then this week it goes ITM and I‚Äôm trying to decide if I chance it‚Äôll be exercised and I lose 100 $GME  at 225, or if I buy the C back even though it‚Äôll cost a lot more than I sold for. After yesterday, I decided I needed to buy it back to save my shares, and just sell other assets or maybe 20 $GME to cover the cost. It goes boom today, probably sitting around 330, and I pulled the trigger and bought the C back for $108. Not 10 minutes later the stock drops, and now I‚Äôm 10K+ in the hole (gonna get margined called on that), and I need $GME at 287 to break even.

Never underestimate how much people are willing to spend on their pets!

gqhyswu;015unknown;1;"I agree that the software Salesforce offers is probably more universally in-demand, but not sure about ServiceNow. I have personal connections that work on the business side for ServiceNow so I have a little more insight on their operations. ServiceNow faces the same business difficulties Palantir willl have to overcome - how can a platform that was initially designed for a large entreprise be redesigned to cater toward small businesses? ServiceNow leverages third-party vendors to provide custom solutions, so it's possible Palantir goes down the same path. 

What makes me particularly excited about the stock (and I see this in my line of work) is that companies you wouldn't expect to be big data companies are in fact becoming big data companies. Traditional non-tech companies have accumulated pbs of data and are struggling to make sense of what all this data means. In ten to twenty years, what will distinguishes a company from its competitors are the insights they gain from the data.

Without delving too deep into Palantir's valuation, there's always a certain level of discomfort in investing in these high-growth tech companies, By definition, the high-growth is built into the price of the company. Who knows though? If Palantir faces reduced growth, it's possible pltr will be a 10 dollar stock in five years. On the flipside, if Palantir manages to leverage its expertise into locking down the big data market, I wouldn't be surprised to see it valued more than Salesforce in five to ten years.";investing;2021-03-10 21:55:09

gqgriad;reaper527;1;"personally i'm more optimistic on apple right now than disney. 

disney is letting their politics interfere with business as they remove classic movies like dumbo and peter pan from their service (which in turn means it's probably only a matter of time until they black list the movies for bluray sales / park appearances / etc.). they're also removing people from high profile successful shows like carano on the mandalorian.

at some point, if they continue going down that route it's going to bite them in the ass. nostalgia is a powerful thing and disney is opting to throw the things people are nostalgic about in the trash while kneecapping their new content.

they're not going bankrupt or tanking any time soon, i just don't see room for massive growth above and beyond what they did this year. i picked up some shares this time last year, but don't have any plans to get more. 

aapl on the other hand while having the same politics isn't letting it interfere with their business. they'll continue to grow, and if anything comes from the ""apple car"", that stock is going to explode. (yes, i realize they probably won't ""make"" a car and will probably just partner with a company that does while providing self-driving and various other tech, but the point still stands)

as far as investing **now** goes, aapl is down a bit, while dis is at all time highs. timing wise, aapl is definitely a better pickup right now. of course, rather than going all in on one with what you go for, i'd probably put like 80% in there and then put 20% in something that isn't either of them but has the chance to grow much larger (like increasing your PLTR holdings, or grabbing SFT or something like that)";stocks;2021-03-10 17:04:08

if the revenue growth rate were 45% each year, we would get 7 billion of revenue by 2025 (1.1b \* 1.45\^5).

09:46 AM EST, 03/10/2021 (MT Newswires) -- GameStop(GME) and AMC Entertainment(AMC) , both higher in Wednesday's early regular session, continue to lead mention counts among the WallStreetBets Reddit crowd, but EV stocks led by Tesla (TSLA) and Nio (NIO) are seeing significant herd momentum on the upside.

Tesla and Nio both popped at the open followed by gains in Li Auto(LI) , Xpeng(XPEV) and Plug Power(PLUG) .

Elsewhere, volume interest has been spiking in the cannabis category, with Aphria(APHA) , Tilray(TLRY) and Aurora Cannabis(ACB) recording a jump in average share volume over the last day.

ARK Innovation ETF (ARKK) is up about 1% early Wednesday after soaring more than 10% Tuesday.

Continue watching Palantir(PLTR) as its mention count and share volume interest has been growing.

gqg7yy2;insomniaxs;1;"Okay it might be difficult to convince you, but I'll try to defend my investment in Palantir. 

Palantir has a relatively small team of well-paid software engineers, and the jobs are highly sought after. I would argue that the likes of Amazon or Apple are much shittier in terms of treating their employees (warehouse/factory workers). 

I believe in 'disruptive tech', like PLTR, because I think we need it to save ourselves from falling into some stagnant and miserable economic state. I am not a big fan of big consumer product conglomerates or oil/gas companies, because I don't think they will eventually help us create a better world.

Palantir is well-equipped to help resolve some of the issues we're facing in the world. For instance, Palantir software helps companies measure and decrease their carbon footprint.

There was this scandal about PLTR's contract with ICE. Now, I think this is of course not the greatest thing it has done. But immigration has been a contentious issue in the US for decades, and no US admin has ever had an unconditional open border policy, even if they play lip service to it. 

I think Palantir is in a difficult spot, because one of its aims is to help democratically elected governments and will therefore not formulate its own ethical stance if said government is asking them to do something regarding defence/immigration. PLTR is in the executive branch as a company, not the policy making branch.

All of this is ethically debatable, but I think there isn't an ethically pure path. Everything we do involves some level of hypocrisy and we need to deal with that appropriately on a personal level.

If you take this question to the extreme it gets close to: 

is there ethical consumption/investment under capitalism? 

Well, maybe not completely, but the alternatives to some form of capitalism also don't have an amazing track record.";investing;2021-03-10 14:49:40

Other wallstreetbets Reddit stocks were mixed. AMC (AMC) followed suit trading up 7%, and Blackberry (BB) was up 2%, while Nokia(NOK) was up 2% and Palantir(PLTR) was inching toward 1% up early Wednesday.

Other wallstreetbets Reddit stocks were down Wednesday pre-bell, including Tesla (TSLA) that traded slightly lower and UWMC that was down 1%. Rocket Cos(RKT). (RKT) was also slightly down, and so were Advanced Micro Devices(AMD) and Apple(AAPL) .

* PLTR has 1.47Bn shares outstanding, compared to snowflakes 220Mn.

* Snowflake has competition that PLTR doesn't have, thanks to its focus on cloud-based data storage over integrating into customer computer systems. 

* Snowflake also appears to go for the easy contracts while ignoring the whales. Basically the opposite of PLTR.

* Because of the previous 2 points, Snowflake will likely have higher initial revenue, but in a much more saturated market and competing against industry giant's like Google and Microsoft. This could hurt their revenue in the future. 

* PLTR has more experience and this seems to show. Before Snowflake was even an idea, PLTR were playing Minority Report for the US military in Afghanistan and Iraq.";investing;2021-03-10 12:35:52

gqfqr7d;Nemisis_the_2nd;1;"&gt; Zero moat

OP explained their moat, at least partially, but didn't seem to realise they did it. PLTR works with big companies with huge and complicated data analysis needs. Implementing something that meets those needs can potentially take 6 months or more. The PLTR strategy is to target the biggest, most complicated customers and effectively install the software for free, only properly charging the customer once the software is up and running. This creates a niche in the market and a massive price barrier for competitors. Its also why PLTR is going to take a while for its revenue to get up to speed.";investing;2021-03-10 12:00:23

gqfesqf;cindybu2020;1;"Absolutely agree with this. 25% portfolio in it. I think it has comfortable long term value of \~15-20 and short term surge potential based on hype/momentum of easily hitting the 25-45 range.  


A big advantage of UWMC compared to RKT is the smaller market cap, more like GME instead of PLTR. This allows retail investors to surge the price more";wallstreetbets;2021-03-10 08:56:39
gqfek2a;htblind;1;" Not financial advice.

&gt;You need to be careful:   
&gt;  
&gt;1) $45 is 30x revenue (this is higher than TSLA, SNOW, PLTR valuation).  
&gt;  
&gt; 2) They were priced at $8bn in Nov, now $30bn mkt caps?   
&gt;  
&gt;3) They sold $520m of series H funding or 12m shares in Jan 2021 so that they did not need to do the IPO's ""offering"" and go direct. What this means is they convinced &lt; 10 investors to pony up the funds for 12m shares at $45 that they can tell you the entire 652 million shares is all worth $45 also.  
&gt;  
&gt;With the IPO route, the bankers would have priced it at $15 and it doubles like AI, ABNB, DASH, so it'd be $30. But they are smart to tell you that it's worth $45, hoping you will pay $70/$80/$90. And if that happens, this stock will be more expensive than any stocks I know.  
&gt;  
&gt;Also, why Direct Listing? Because there will not be a lock up period of 180 days. Without it the investors can sell on day 1. But why does it matter? Because after covid, kids will go to school, spend time at pool parties, soccer games than playing. Guess what would happen to earnings and then stock price?  
&gt;  
&gt;What they did was brilliant. They did an IPO without and IPO. They got the IPO money with series H funding, then the DPO allowed them to sell on day 1 (using 12/652m shares or 1.8% of shares to pump the value of the company by 300%). They got a sky-high valuation, more than TSLA could. And in their words, they saved $1bn of banker fees. The only losers? I think maybe those who buy from their selling out.

gqf8byf;Jurassic-Jay;1;"Looking for high growth and possibilities for massive advancement of the $1k you‚Äôre probably going to want to look at stuff with higher upside.  
PLTR is one I like and is being bunched in with ‚Äúmeme stocks‚Äù but it is a legitimate company with the possibility for a big edge.   
I saw someone else reccomend and I agree because it is for a kid the RBLX IPO tommorow would be a fun speculation - When/if they get bought out a few years down the line that would be some relatively easy money again with high upside.    
AAPL and DIS are two staples of my own portfolio so you really can‚Äôt go wrong there either - but upside is slightly more limited.   
Electric cars and technology might be a fun industry to consider. Avoid Tesla at all costs, but a little research into companies like Volkswagen or Toyota who are making big strides for electric vehicles in the next year or two offers some quality potential. Their stocks have historically been limited, but if Tesla is any example, if their electric cars are a huge hit their market caps could change drastically.

If you want to be more hands on and be even riskier, you're going to have to just read a lot and look into tickers that come up and start picking your own stocks. Interestingly, most of these hype stocks like TSLA, PLTR, etc. are all already in the ARK funds so in the end, if you like a particular stock like TSLA over everything else then you could just allocate more money to TSLA than everything else vs. it being capped at 10% in an ARKK fund. 

Finally you should be aware that lump sum investing is better than DCAing monthly 70% of the time.";stocks;2021-03-10 03:41:20

gqep48c;Newtothepartay;2;"Suggestion: before you pull the trigger on KO, pull up a ten year chart, or Pepsi for that matter... if you are looking for growth in that sector, try KDP (this was just suggested to me)

KO, is the largest player in a stagnant sector. Even if they invented New Coke (pun intended), they cannot move the needle.   
VZ might give you more bang for your buck, better dividend.

I personally have SO and D, good dividend... like KO and VZ, not big movers, but my cost basis is so low that my actual return is double digits...

You can probably tell I follow dividend stocks, they are stable

There are share lockups, there were for SPOT and for PLTR and there are for RBLX.

The number you're showing is the listed shares, a company can have more shares than are listed.

From the S-1 form (capitalization section):

&gt; Convertible preferred stock, $0.0001 par value per share: 349,522,440 shares authorized, 337,235,090 shares issued and outstanding, actual; no shares authorized, no shares issued or outstanding, pro forma

&gt; Class A common stock, $0.0001 par value per share: 675,000,000 shares authorized, 144,039,488 shares issued and outstanding, actual; 4,935,000,000 shares authorized, 493,163,464 shares issued and outstanding, pro forma

&gt; Class B common stock, $0.0001 par value per share: 65,000,000 shares authorized, 57,287,302 issued and outstanding, actual and pro forma

Class A + B + preferred stock **issued** = 144,039,488 + 57,287,302  + 337,235,090 = 538.5M shares
Class A + B + preferred **Authorized** = 4.935B + 65M  + 349.5M (I missed this number in my first look) = 5.35B shares

Given what I've read about the leadership I am going with the shares authorized numbers

gqcwry9;Fuzzers;1;"""There has to be a reason why this company thats doubled its market cap within the last 8 months and hasn't significantly increased its revenue to match its valuation isn't going up!""

Like come on folks. You'll be lucky to see most tech trade sideways for the next year or two. Company evaluations STILL matter, and when something is trading at a stupidly high P/S or P/E (Looking at you, PLTR), its due for a correction. Long term evaluation matters too, but my god doubling your market cap without significantly increasing revenue/earnings is just a recipe for disappointment.

Always do a quick glance over current and future estimates of P/S, P/E, PEG. Just because a company is going to perform stellar in the future does not mean its current evaluation is attractive for investments.";stocks;2021-03-09 18:39:08

What you see is one thing in demos. The company is real life minority report. Elon Musk has some really interesting perspectives about this, because it is basically AI. (referring to the dangers of AI being evil or used for evil purposes) Remember, the queries that go in are interpreted by software written by humans. And that engineer's code determines the level of morality of human vs AI... Some people think it is great I find it scary as fuck. And the fact that they did NOT find BIN LADEN leads me to believe it isnt really that great......If you have any questions regardirng Bin Laden, pls research Benazir Bhutto and how it was Omar Sheik that killed Bin Laden. Which further convinces me we are in a big psyop... But it takes a shit ton of critical thinking to evaluate it all. And few are okay with questioning everything. But I will leave you with one bit to look at. 
If you know anything about kidney failure and Bin laden was in END STAGE kidney failure in 01 you know that you cabbot live without dialysis 3-4 times a week.
The compound where (body double) was killed had no dialysis machines in it and NOWHERE near any place to get dialysis 3-4x a week.
You cannot live for more than a week or so off dialysis because you will die from the buildup in your blood. Start there in your research. Because THIS is WHAT PLTR touts as their big victory.
Iran knew it was a body double and Bin Laden was killed by Omar Sheik.

gqcdvut;OldSoul-YoungLibido;3;"Reddit is becoming a little hive minded in their stock picks. Which is annoying if you are looking for diamonds in the rough but it offers a great opportunity, especially with stimulus checks coming.

I've been taking advantage of the high IV by going long on growth stocks that I like and then selling weekly way OTM covered calls. Finding that I can sell a CC on a meme stock with a strike price 25% OTM and still get a hefty premium. I like these stocks so I'm okay with the volatility on the underline security and those weekly CCs are great cash flow. I also don't care if it gets assigned. I'm selling CCs 25% OTM so if it gets assigned I made 25% on the security in one week + the CC premium. If I still like the security I'll just do weekly Cash Covered Puts until it gets assigned as a way to again benefit from the volatility and hopefully buy it at a low.

Today's moves:
Swing trading NRGU
Selling weekly far OTM covered calls for meme stocks I'm long (PLTR, RKT, FUBO)

The market is fluid, unpredictable and 100% a gamble or risk regardless what data and analysts say or advise. (See Warren Buffet interviews for confirmation) 

You can make every right technical / fundemental move and lose money or every wrong one and kill it.

If I was you, i would look at stocks that have a very steady value. ie, their beta is close to 1. That way, you're not just gambling. Cause right now, I'd say that you should put your money in ETFs and only invest in stocks with dividends because if you aren't researching the shit out of any companies, then you're pretty much gambling.   


For the most part, Cannabis companies may grow, but look at any company and their finances are garbage. I can't find one company that has good finances that is in the weed business.

gqb9egq;MauerAstronaut;1;"Lots of talk about meme stocks. With those you can win hard but also lose hard. In January, illegal shenanigans happened, many people missed the exit point and became bag holders. Some of those are green again now, others are not. GameStop is a unique situation, all those new squeeze plays are super dangerous.

Over the last few weeks, growth and tech stocks were getting butchered. The rebound should be as massive as the pullback, so those might give you a head start. Hot ones are, among others, PLTR, ROKU, SKLZ. Personally, I would probably buy growth now and set a limit of 50‚Äì100% gain to sell half and put it into safer investments. Or put all in ARK ETFs, because the are into growth but know better than you or me how to rotate.

Half-meme stocks that might be an idea: BB and PLTR (already mentioned but fits here).

Note that I have not been investing for very long and you generally should not trust anyone pumping any stock. I have a position in PLTR and BB and still thinking about the other ones.";stocks;2021-03-09 10:01:00

It's great for a the long haul (I'm picking up shares as it drops), but wall street is short sighted, and this stock is still way overvalued. Delta Airlines has a similar market cap, even at the 22/share valuation.

I understand they have a high profit margin, but even taking that into account the valuation still makes no sense.

They have two businesses at once - a government arm and a commercial arm. Each have different trajectories and benefits/difficulties. Recent deals with 3M for analysis of mask distribution and over the weekend a deal with Amazon Web Services both strong signs for their commercial side. If you were looking for an intro to the bullish case for PLTR, I‚Äôd suggest their website itself to see what products they offer, and this article from Capital dot com : https://capital.com/amp/palantir-stock-forecast-2021-2025;investing;2021-03-08 22:41:12

Here is something from wikipedia
The company is known for three projects in particular: Palantir Gotham, Palantir Metropolis, and Palantir Foundry. Palantir Gotham is used by counter-terrorism analysts at offices in the United States Intelligence Community (USIC) and United States Department of Defense.[6] In the past, Gotham was used by fraud investigators at the Recovery Accountability and Transparency Board, a former US federal agency which operated from 2009 to 2015. Gotham was also used by cyber analysts at Information Warfare Monitor, a Canadian public-private venture which operated from 2003 to 2012. Palantir Metropolis is used by hedge funds, banks, and financial services firms.[7][8] Palantir Foundry is used by corporate clients such as Morgan Stanley, Merck KGaA, Airbus, and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV.[9]";wallstreetbets;2021-03-08 19:34:53

gq8sgcd;Lord_Python_Of_WSB;1;"&gt;a stock should not double unless some income also basically doubles

What? You must be new to investing if that's what you think , share price reflect the future value and potential to create more value of a company generally not the other way around  and aapl was trading at a huge discount.
Also stock barely trade at a fair value , they are mostly trading under or over the actual value.

I can't believe what I'm reading.  There are a billion factored into Share price,  if it was a simple oh this company makes this much so this is how much it worth  there wouldn't be hundreds of thousands of analysts getting paid 6 figure to analyze a company to the bone.

Both aapl and pltr are over value but if you had to compare aapl vs pltr only , aapl looks fking cheap AF .

Aapl is trading at 32 p.e and forward p.e  of high 20s

What's the forward p.e for pltr ?

An undervalue stock has a easier time to double and become overvalued than an overvalued stock to double to become-out-of-this-universe-valued stock regardless of market cap.

Aapl is a very bad if not the worse stock to use in your case.

Pltr is all contracts,  100% of its business so 100% of  the time its running the risk of not getting renewed

gq8jd9z;Rock_it_Scientist;1;"I respect those strategies.  I want to sell calls on my GME shares so bad but it has the potential to get insane.  I have held of so far.

Back during the peak I had 500 shares and Had an order to sell $800C for $90.00 per contract.  I never submitted the order and I regret it ever since lol.

I play covered calls on stocks I like (besides GME, we like the stock).  AMD, ETSY, ARKK, PINS, PLTR, TQQQ, NET, SQ.  I try to make 10-20% annulized on my covered calls so is boring but has made me some good gains.";wallstreetbets;2021-03-08 18:13:44

Plus most of my money was made during insane unforeseen rally‚Äôs so I don‚Äôt want to be short calls going into that. To each his own tho. At the moment I‚Äôve been daytrading PLTR CC‚Äôs and doing consistently well on that front, using the premiums to buy more shares.;wallstreetbets;2021-03-08 18:09:54

So for around 1000 bucks you can pick up a contract for 100 shares at like 25 strike or something.

There's more risk than shares outright. But if you think it's going to be higher than 35/share in a year (25 + 10 premium) if it's at like 60 in a year, you can exercise if you want those shares or sell the contract for the IV.

Palantir specializes in deepfuckingdata analyses mainly for governmental clients. what does that mean? It means, for example, that to get detailed info on someone, all you would need is a name and license plate number and Palantir does the rest. It performs a deep search of all criminal, financial, medical, communication, and clandestine agency records on the target. 

The company‚Äôs tech helped locate Osama bin fucking Laden in 2011 and is being used to trace COVID-19 infections, track medical supply chains, and even predict outbreaks in pandemic hot zones. Think of the company as a search engine for deep analysis of petabytes (or millions of gigabytes) of data.

It's not magic, it's not groundbreaking, it's just fking enterprise software using statistics and bunch of other algorithms to get you the answer. Plenty of enterprise software companies do that. 

The reason to invest in PLTR is because of the portfolio of clients Palantir is amassing and the momentum they have. This software is a pain in the ass to replace.

gq5t46v;DingoProfessional635;1;Yup. If we‚Äôre being aggressive, I‚Äôd say pltr reaches $45 next Jan. His best chance is to hope for a spike later this year when pltr starts to build some hype and gets a bump from speculative buyers.;wallstreetbets;2021-03-08 01:01:22

1) you are very VERY lucky to even be able to throw away some of your money on these bullshit markets. Millions of people are struggling to make it to the next day. While you have a chance to thrive, people are fighting to survive another moment. 

2) Attack on Titan released a new episode and it‚Äôs fucking FIRE. One of the best shows I have ever seen. 

Good luck tomorrow retards.
