gr8a6ce;Dekkars;1;"Alright Ya'll. 3/17 Market thread here.  


Premarket Update - 8:25 am.

Here is the Ortex SI for this morning: [https://imgur.com/a/WLGxmpY](https://imgur.com/a/WLGxmpY)

As you can see SI went up 700k shares, with days to cover going up a bit too. Nothing crazy here, but shorts clearly spent a bunch of shares yesterday to drive the price back down. We all saw it happen, that is how they did it.   


Option Open Interest: 

Here is 3/19 OI for this morning: [https://imgur.com/a/HFlhpb3](https://imgur.com/a/HFlhpb3)

I haven't found an easy way to get historical data (nor can I make those beautiful flux charts u/pennyether can) but the gist of this is that:

15c - Since Friday they've closed \~5000 OI on this sucker. This was the most traded option on Friday/Monday, and on Friday alone half the total OI was traded. 

17.5c - Since Friday this has GAINED \~5000 OI and yesterday this was by far the most traded option (volume was, again, half the total OI)

20c - Also gone up, not exactly sure how much but a few thousand.

Also - If it isn't readily apparent the OI on this is absolutely absurd. Here is NIO's OI for example: [https://imgur.com/a/HFlhpb3](https://imgur.com/a/HFlhpb3)

We see that in proportion there are FAR more puts and the call OI is more distributed without the ramp that we are seeing in GOEV. NIO also has **4.5X THE FLOAT OF GOEV. This means to be completely equivalent the highest OI strike (45c) would need \~45k more OI to equal what GOEV has going on at its 15c.** Look at any other equivalent stock and you'll see that our OI is honestly bananas. 

What I THINK we are seeing here is the Tai Chi hands that u/BrotherLuminous has been talking about. They used the 15c to push the price up from $11 to $15, and are now using the 17.5c to push the price up further. They've achieved the $15 pt and at several points during the rise the $15c has had a delta of 1.0. This means it is completely hedged and isn't contributing to the rise of the stock price.

By moving into the 17.5c they can make sure that during these momentum pushes they have to keep on hedging and keep pushing the price higher. 

&amp;#x200B;

Price Movement / Volume:

After 11am or so yesterday the entire market started holding it's breath waiting for jpow to do... Something? Our volume was low yesterday afternoon and shorts took advantage of that to shove 700k shares down our throats and drive the price down. 

If you haven't noticed almost everything is red. So while it sucks that our benevolent rulers haven't popped the price up in AH/Premarket there has been relatively little volume compared to what it usually is. 

I'm watching for us to maintain the $15 price (premarket doesn't count, seriously if someone came in right now wanting to buy 3k shares they could pop the price to 16.50 that is how shallow the ask depth is.)

I think our usual momentum pop is going to be more subdued than it typically is with everyone waiting for JPOW at 11. I am hoping our second spike that tends to happen around that time will actually be stronger given additional market momentum. 

My plan is to sell some of my 3/19 15cs during a spike and save that capital for another downturn. I'm definitely not selling for a loss. This WILL go back up. Today just might be a rough day. 

Positions:

\~200 3/19 15c

gr86ou9;dr0nec0ma;1;"If anything, this has finally convinced me to get out of Plug and ICLN altogether. The last few months we've seen a green energy hype much like the last time and I'm convinced the bubble is bursting.

We expected it to be different this time because of the Biden/Trump election, Covid, and the over-hyped EV industry. We thought Biden would heavily focus on green energy after rejoining the Paris accord, but like most campaign promises that quickly fell through and nothing substantial happened after that. He's just pushing old policies while barely keeping the country together (figuratively in terms of the economy/Covid/Syria and literally in terms of infrastructure).

The timing would be ideal because of Covid. We started working from home and stopped international travel and it had a positive impact on the environment. Oil and gas industries tanked. This would be the ideal moment to start with a clean slate and go all in on renewable energy. Except we didn't, and we're barely in control of the Covid situation. It'll take a good few years to fully recover from the pandemic before we can even start to think about new sources of energy again.

Also, the stock market was obsessed with EV, Tesla and NIO mostly, which are incredibly overvalued. Even Musk admitted that they barely make a profit, can't reach deadlines, and that the battery technology just isn't there yet. It'll take years before they are a serious player in the market (serious, as in, actually selling cars and not just branding and over-valuation), and in the meantime other car manufactures are catching up (with the help of Apple, Gates, etc., possibly even a partnership with Tesla in the future so that Musk can focus on tech rather than manufacturing).

Don't get me wrong, we are definitely moving towards other sources of energy, if not nuclear than most likely renewable. But we aren't there yet. The technology isn't ready, most companies are still in their infancy (compared to the current big players), and it'll take years of Covid recovery and political lobbying before we'll make a serious investment in green energy again. You can go long on the current companies, but whose to say these are still the big players 10, 15 years from now? Especially when companies like Plug are faltering and traditional Oil and Gas is pivoting towards renewable energy with much more capital and political backing behind them.";stocks;2021-03-17 11:43:53

Long story short I ended up using margin and ended up at a high of 58K at one point. But I didn't sell. I started thinking ""Well, now on top of initial goals I can also have X amount in retirement by 30, get my mom a decent used car"" and etc. Then the correction happened and I'm barely above 25K now.

gr4br3o;Ehralur;1;"Took a while for me to reply, been a bit busy (and got lost in Valheim).

&gt; That is a massive, massive if. I agree, if they do it and it catches on, absolutely that valuation will make sense. I don't see this massive retail influx growing exponentially though. I'm a retail investor, I'm assuming you are as well, but most retail investors will never spend 100 hours even researching the market, let alone one company like you've done with Tesla. Most of them are like my friends, who get hyped when I show them I make money, download a brokerage app, ask me for financial advice which I don't feel comfortable giving yet, then promptly forget about stocks for another month. I didn't dive into the market until I'd done a solid couple hundred hours of research on how it worked over the span of a few months.

Yeah, that's fair. But I also think the amount of people like myself who have just learned about stocks and how ""easy"" it is to make money with very small long term risk through things like YouTube thanks to the emergence of simple trading apps is going to keep going for a while. If you look at some of the investing channels on YouTube, you can see the growth in audience is enormous and it's quite likely the majority of those viewers are new to investing.

&gt; I think robotaxis will be ready way before FSD, if FSD even ever is. The reality of FSD, from what I've gathered, is that it's nowhere near what Musk's vision for it is, and his claim that it'll be ready this year is dubious at best, total BS at worst. If FSD ever is ready, it will be that Tesla has replicated the human mind (or come very, very, close to it), and then they'd absolutely be the biggest company ever.

I definitely think it's not gonna be ready this year, but I also think we're not as far off as a lot of people who are not insiders make it out to be. The improvements the FSD beta has been making are very impressive ([watch this video for example](https://publish.twitter.com/?query=https%3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2FWholeMarsBlog%2Fstatus%2F1370974296730824704&amp;widget=Tweet)) and Dojo (the most powerful supercomputer in the world built to improve the neural network machine learning) isn't even up and running yet.

&gt; I don't think there's any case that the Tesla stock price isn't a massive overvaluation based on the present day. They're not unique in that respect at all, that's the case for much of the EV sector, and I think that the sector as a whole will cool off gradually, or stagnate despite the companies actually growing.

This is a very complex one, as there are a lot of factors. I'll just name a few:

* First of all, I don't think it's relevant whether a company like Tesla is overvalued based on what it does today. It's an extreme growth company, so no investor is looking at what they're doing today. The stock price will always be forward looking by a few years, and the longer the company is expected to maintain that growth the more forward looking the stock price will be.
* Tesla is a lot less richly valued than most other EV companies. This might sound surprising, but Nio for example is trading at the same valuation Tesla was 1,5 years ago despite being at the production Tesla was at 5 years ago. Nio also still has the most challenging milestones for an automotive company ahead of itself; getting to profitability and getting to mass production. On top of that, Nio doesn't have nearly as many (future) products outside of automotive as Tesla does and they're not vertically integrated like Tesla. So in comparison to other EV companies, Tesla is really not as highly valued as they might seem.
* Legacy automotive companies will need to transition from their highly profitable ICE business to an EV/software business. This will be extremely expensive and will contain a period of 5-10 years where these companies will nowhere near as profitable as they are today and probably not even profitable at all. Especially with the balance sheet of some of these companies (Ford or GM for example), this will create a huge risk of bankruptcy and the stock price has that priced in. This in turn makes EVs look even more expensive, because they're valued so much more highly than legacy automakers, but for (partially) good reason.

&gt; Man, maybe I'm more bearish than you, but I feel like when you've got a ""can't lose"" situation it's always because you're overlooking something or just being blindly optimistic. 15% annual on top of the 600-800 range it's trading at now? Let's say, for the sake of argument, it settles at 700. That would just about double it in 5 years and see it trading at 1400 USD. Maybe it'll hit 1400 USD with the tidal wave of inflation that's bound to come when you increase the money supply by 30% in a year (unless the MMT folks are right after all), but that would see the value of a dollar plummet significantly so you wouldn't see much of a real return on each share. Tesla has been adding to the float pretty consistently for years now as well, that'll drive the price down if they continue to do so. I'll address full autonomy in a second.

It's really not that crazy to be honest. Without full autonomy but with a 50% annual growth and increasing margins, Tesla would grow into their current valuation extremely quickly (2-4 years), so even if they fall short of that growth rate a 2x over 10 years is not that unreasonable.

&gt; So this is why I don't see it catching on anytime soon. The risk would have to be lowered by 99.9%, any accident would be latched onto, and if Tesla rushed it out and there were even one glitch that systematically got people hurt or killed, they'd be sued into financial ruin, share price would plummet, FSD would be shelved for years. So that's why I think 2021 is dubious at best, and frankly my real opinion is that it's nonsense, because that's what Elon does, come out with insanely short timelines for revolutionary tech.

Agreed. One aspect you didn't take into consideration however is how countries will not want to fall behind. If one country does successfully manage to get self-driving cars approved and robotaxis become the norm in that country, it will have a massively positive impact on that country's economy and others will want to follow suit. So while it's true that any negative news could mean huge delays, any positive news could also mean huge increases in adoption rate.

&gt; What's your Tesla position? I kinda guessed you had a big one, because if you believe in it this heavily, of course you'd invest. Heck, I'm going to follow it more closely because of this discussion, and I will likely invest at some point when I have some income, because the upside is definitely there. I'd also guess that your cost basis is low, therefore raising your risk tolerance because you've locked in gains. If I had invested a year ago, for example, I'd be much, much more likely to be bullish, but I'm fairly certain we're coming at it from different angles, me feeling I might lose big, you already having gained big.

I started investing at the start of 2020 (both in Tesla and investing in general) with about 6,000 Euros in Tesla and added another 1k over the following 6 months, up to a total of 62 shares post split. Right now I still own 53 shares as I sold a few to invest in other opportunities and balance out my portfolio a little bit. Tesla is still 50% of my portfolio and I intend to keep it that way for the next couple of years unless I find a company I'm equally confident in.

But yes, it's definitely easier for me to hold with the amount of gains I've made, even though it doesn't really matter if you lose money you've earned from a job or money you've gained from stocks. I'd definitely be more conservative if I would starting investing now, and probably wouldn't put 50% of my portfolio into Tesla in that scenario. The way I see it, when I started investing Tesla had a huge chance to 10x or much more with a small chance of bankruptcy. Today, Tesla has a reasonable chance to 10x, with very little chance to do more than that, but almost no chance of bankruptcy. The risk/reward is completely different.

&gt; I think the Tesla bulls online who don't actually provide proper reasoning (AngelaQQ and her lemonade stand analogy, for example) are very dangerous, because they're just doing ""to the moon rocket emoji"" type stuff, suckering people who think ""stonks only go up"" and will panic sell when they see a red day, let alone a red week or month. But of course, much of the crowd sees a wall of text and thinks ""wow this person wrote a lot, they must be 100% right!""

Absolutely. I've also seen a lot of these people in stocks like Nio or some of the SPAC stocks. It's very important to filter those people out.

&gt; It's so nice to actually have an exchange of ideas! I have stupid arguments all the time whether it's stocks, politics, sports, whatever, where people don't engage in and just go to insulting me, dismissing valid points, and getting mad when they encounter information that proves them wrong or that they simply did not know. I'll check out Tesla Daily for sure, like I said you've definitely made me a little more bullish on Tesla.

What is fact is that all of the major EV contenders have partnered with one or another of the leading solid state battery researchers.

I'm looking at lithium extractors and processors and companies working on solid state lithium batteries, and parts manufacturers(power trains) as parts of the supply chain that really have nowhere to go but up.

There are also many charging companies ranging from home to commercial to networked. A huge network that isn't even public (Electrify America) is a result of Volkswagen's $2bil fine focused towards becoming more electrified. Lots of volatility there.";investing;2021-03-16 12:46:55

I do think that much of what we are seeing in the EV space resembles the early internet companies.  Many large players like Nio, Lucid, etc. Are simply here because they are relatively early to the game, but they present little or no innovation to the marketplace.

gr44j6p;Digital-Soup;1;I think a lot people saw how much Tesla stock has risen and think they can grab the next Tesla by investing in EV startups. The problem with that logic is Tesla's success hasn't made other EV companies more likely to succeed, it's made them more likely to fail because now there's established competition in the space. Consumer automotive is a tough market to break into. There's a lot of regulations and start-up costs. It is very easy to get a basic prototype rolling around your garage to show to investors though.

The government grants schemes, admittedly, have been a bit of a crutch for Nio as it has allowed them to be very price competitive with the likes of Tesla despite having more premium vehicles. But on the flip side, Nio have struck some smart deals in relation to autonomous driving, meaning they don't do the brunt of the R&amp;D themselves, and they've spent a lot of time and money on their patented battery swap stations to make sure that infrastructure exists for all the cars they are selling.

Again, I have a position and am possibly biased, but I think Nio answers a lot of the questions that you have raised. Also, they are posed to be the big domestic winner in China, and along with Tesla (and possibly xpeng) should have a large market share.";investing;2021-03-16 11:07:21

gr3rtre;abrasiveteapot;1;"TL;DR the exact same thing happened in the 1920s as is happening now: hundreds of car manufacturers, the vast majority of whom will fail, whether there's a consolidation like the one that created GM remains to be seen. It is however extremely likely that many legacy ICE manufacturers will be amongst those who fail as well.

1. The majority of players in the EV space have EV cars on the deck (Tesla, NIO, VW, GM, Ford etc), the ones who don't are the ones that are highly risky (in particular Nikola), but the Tesla story also shows that there are advantages to starting from scratch as well as disadvantages - the biggest one being the lack of legacy factories which will cost money to wind down

2. Yes. It is, and the US govt has several times bailed it out because it means jobs, however worldwide only the most efficient manufacturers will survive, and that means many existing ICE coys will fail or consolidate (Stellaris for example). Poorly run EV and poorly run ICE will both fail

3. The oil industry (worldwide inclduing the US) is also heavily subsidised both directly, through tax breaks, and through the provision of governement provided infrastructure. Last time I read up on it the value exceeded EV subsidies by a factor of  10 or more but that was a few years ago.

4. Even if your EV is powered entirely by brown coal (the worst type) or hell, a diesel generator you are doing less damage than gasoline or diesel ICE cars do as stationary engines of any type are far far more efficient than ones that are constantly changing revs to deal with traffic. And that ignores the fact that all countries, even the US (despite the oil lobby) are moving rapidly towards renewables and low CO2 generation (wind, solar, thermal, hydro etc, it has dramatically improved over the last decade, and continues to improve. Large battery plants like Horndale in South Australia and the ones going into California and Texas, allow the storage of intermittent renewables like solar and wind.

5. Shrug. There is always money available for startups regardless of industry, there's been billions of technology startups up fire up, flicker and die. Risk capital is built into the market and there's been no shortage of people willing to invest to date.";investing;2021-03-16 09:05:17

gr39g76;directionalbias;2;"Your assessment is good - it displays good fundamental analysis. 

The idea that EV's are a clean industry, apart from how the charging mechanisms will be implemented, is enough to at least pass a cursory review from most retail and even institutions that advertise an ESG flavor to their funds.  It makes people feel good to think they're doing something good for the environment.  Funds know this and they exploit this.  I know market players that use this moral compass in their trades.  

Cultish behavior - looking at you Technoking and TSLA.  They're a religion.  Good luck shorting a religion.  Society has been trying to do that for a few hundred years and it's still around.

Your typical day trader will appreciate the volatility and liquidity that some of these names offer.  A 5 - 10% swing intraday?  That's enough to entice some traders for sure.

There are some macro elements as well.  Long EV is effectively short fossil fuel.  I get it, that's not 100% true but the idea persists.  Who knows, that may be more true in the future with the proper technological advances.

Long foreign EV may offer an international exposure that a player wants.  I personally am long NIO mostly because I believe that China will have a much more stable supply chain to support their vehicles, battery, and charging model vs any other western EV company.

gr16ufq;DRMRCX;1;"That's fair - I realised how concentrated it was getting after closing positions on JWN, TSLA (terrible mistake on my part there, expected the downtrend to continue for longer, took my profits and gambled on it rather than just waiting if it actually goes there and averaging down if it went really low) and NIO. So looking to restructure now. Will take some time to look into other companies that interest me, so I'm also contemplating whether to take some of my profits on the MJ plays in the meantime. But, I guess, they're doing decently, so I might as well keep the money there in the meantime. Due to closing the positions and taking some profits I have roughly 25% of my portfolio in cash waiting to be reinvested.

You literally said that NIO will only be able to produce 7.5k EVs in the second quarter of 2021; I directly quoted you which I, and everyone else here can see above. Then when I correctly show that you're clearly wrong, and quote the actual transcript of the earnings, you say ""it's not incorrect"", when in fact it is; you were incorrect. 

NIO's CEO said they'll be producing 7,500 EVs **per month** in Q2. 

The second paragraph you've now introduced, in absolutely no way validated your incorrect assertion; all you've done is highlight that you read that paragraph first--or perhaps only that paragraph--which says 7,500, and you've then assumed that NIO will only be able to produce 7,500 total in Q2; when if you bothered to read the whole transcript, you'd know that the CEO Willie Li, specifically said they're going to produce 7,500 per month, which will then further increase in July.

gr08srs;the_mirror_viewer01;1;"&gt; the huge global chip shortage that will limit NIO‚Äôs production capacity to just 7.5K in the 2nd quarter of 2021 

This is factually incorrect; this is the answer I gave to someone else who didn't correctly read the transcript of NIO's recent earnings, by the CEO William Li Bin; in his words:

""However, just like I mentioned because of the constraints of the chipset supply and the battery supply, **in the second quarter we may only be able to secure overall supply chain production capacity of 7,500 units per month**"".

And also:

""So it means that probably the annual production capacity is going to reach **150,000 units under one shift and 300,000 units under two shifts by the end of this year or the beginning of next year**."".

So it is in fact 7,500 per month in Q2, which will then ramp up to 12,500, and then again to 25,000 per month.

gqzmtdo;HalfAsCat;1;"There are so many flaws and honestly where to start with this ""company""

First of all the whole concept runs against itself. What I mean. NIO wants to deliver a system of exchanging batteries. Now, imagine having hundreds of cars waiting in a station to exchange batteries. How many batteries does an exchange station have to service in a big city? It will receive hundreds or thousands of customers every day 24/7, this needs to be a massive facility with wait lines and staff to operate it. The second problem is space and price of exchange stations. Can you imagine the cost of buying or renting spaces in every neighborhood in every city to operate these exchange stations? Third, why the company wants to put so much effort into exchange stations - a concept with so many flaws - they don't trust their batteries? I believe their research is poor and they don't trust their batteries at all. How many times they announced various ranges for their batteries which in reality are much smaller than announced. These 250km batteries for SUV are laughable, who on his mind will spend 50000+ USD for an SUV with only 250km range. Imagine if you are in a small city now with no ""battery exchange stations"" nearby. 


Fourth, after so many years of ""development"" their cars don't  have English menus yet - isn't that crazy, honestly, what is more simple to do than that? This also proves that their development team is poor. They haven't even solved simple problems and people believe this is worth to be in equal market cap levels with Mercedes-Benz. 

Fifth, if the cars are ""so good"", why they haven't applied to participate in any US or EU safety tests, like the EURO NCAP tests? People say they are about to start exporting cars to Europe this year, yet they haven't done any EURO NCAP tests on their cars. 

Sixth is the price they target. They want to compete with the luxury market of Europe, Japan and US. Do you really believe this is the strength of Chinese manufacturing? Will anyone get this over a Porsche? Have you seen these internet ads of these ""luxury watches"" from China, which all have the same cheap mechanism of about 5$ and all claim to be ""better"" than the Swiss made? Pretty much it's the same story with the ""luxury"" car makers from China with the 250km range batteries.";investing;2021-03-15 07:00:51

gqvp1kz;aka0007;1;"The ET7, with a 100 kW (not solid-state) battery that should be out beginning of next year will cost about the same as a the current price on a Long-Range Model S. They will find the high-end category for EV sedans might be a little more competitive then they like and doubt they will sell that many. It is a cool car, but don't assume it will be much of a money-maker. Further, Telsa can lower the price on the Model S if demand weakens and still make money, not sure the same can be said about Nio. Again, the swappable design will cost more to make and cars will be worse for it, there is simply no escaping that inherent quality.

The one with the solid-state battery is not due to come out till end of 2022 and no one knows what the price will be. It is a 150 kWh pack supposedly. Regarding your concern about solid-state cycle life, it makes no sense what you say. The end cost is ultimately more to the customer if the battery has a shorter life. It does not matter if you lease or buy. Unless Nio is not making money.

As to choice of leasing or buying the battery, it is irrelevant. In both cases you are making the car worse and more costly to build to have battery swapping. Nothing about the way the car is built changes, rather just something about how the ownership aspect of the battery changes.

FYI, regarding solid-state claims. Until they demonstrate the tech, you should assume it is vaporware.  Right now the only company I have any degree of confidence in that they might actually get a solid-state battery out in the next few years is quantumscape and even there it is not certain. I am extremely skeptical of the claim that Nio has a battery partner ready to mass produce solid-state batteries for the end of 2022. These claims are marketing designed to reassure jittery investors. Toyota, also is suggesting they will have a solid-state car out soon, and again, until you demonstrate a viable solid-state battery, I assume it is vapor-ware.";wallstreetbets;2021-03-14 07:31:18

Key  takeaway - Beetcoin mining indeed takes up a lot of energy, but  consumption of energy does not necessarily equate to more pollution

One  possible investment thesis is that if you are bullish on beetcoin as a store of value and as more institutions adopt it, then all the more you  should be bullish on renewables

gqvmfsw;jameskwonlee;1;"Thanks for your comments. I'd love to respond to this:

&gt;from a practical standpoint and a price standpoint, battery swapping is a dead-end. It might be necessary as a stop-gap, so possible room for Nio's solution for the time being, but just don't see it being a thing in a few years.

""Battery Tech"" - Nio has been investing and r &amp; d'ing heavily into battery tech. Nio's new ET7 sedan which was presented on Nio Day, will have solid state batteries that charge in less than 10-minutes and have a range of over 1000km. This will make Nio the first EV car company in the world to release a sedan with solid state batteries!

""Battery Swap""  Your comments seem to imply that Nio only does battery swap. Not true. Nio has power charging stations too. They're mobile phone operated. Also, if you buy a Nio, you don't have to battery swap at all. If you do opt in to BaaS, then the car is over $10K cheaper to buy, because you don't have to pay for the battery, you'd be leasing it.

""Better Batteries will replace the need for Battery Swap"" Not at the moment. Even the best solid state batteries have limited cycles compared to liquid lithium ion batteries. Battery swap will prevent customers from having to buy expensive batteries after the cycle limit is reached. Nio's BaaS is great for the customer because they don't have to buy expensive batteries every 8-10 years. It's great for Nio because they collect a subscription fee and generate revenue whether or not they sell new cars. 

Hope these address your concerns. All I can say though is, even if you disagree with everything I say, please think of your family and do not buy puts. Just trust me bro, it would be one of the worst decisions you'd make in your life.";wallstreetbets;2021-03-14 06:50:50
gqvloq9;aka0007;1;"NYC can put many curb side charging stations that you pay to park your car overnight at while it charges.

Garages (not your private one) in plenty of cities have charging stalls and can expand that as well.

The link below is just a start (in NYC).

[https://nycdotprojects.info/project/839/overview](https://nycdotprojects.info/project/839/overview)

As to flash charging that is ridiculous. Lucid is claiming they can charge 20 miles per minute. The Model 3 with a 250 kW charger can charge 15 miles per minute (with the upcoming 4680 cells the max charge rate will be significantly higher due to the lower electrical resistance). Now we don't need to talk about charging to 100% rather if I have a price competitive car that at about 85% of range has the same range as Nio's offering, then all I need to know is how long it takes to charge to 85% to see how inconvenient this is. Assuming we can get 25 miles of charge per minute, then a Nio swappable batter that gives you 200 miles of range, would be equivalent to charging about 150 miles of range (you are not swapping your battery at 0 miles of range left, more likely something between 25-75 miles), which would be 6 minutes.

But really the whole issue is moot, as cities will provide slow curb-side charges that you can park by over night (for a fee).

gqvfirk;aka0007;1;"I don't like NIO because battery-swapping is ultimately a dead-end.

There are several reasons and they interweave with each other but here is some brief info...

1. Building a swappable battery, means you are building an inferior car. That means additional cost and weight in how the car is built. Additional weight means less range (and more wear on the car, such as shorter tire-life).
2. As EV range is increasing, the choice to buy a better car with a non-swappable battery versus an inferior one with a swappable battery becomes clearer. Consumers will choose cars that are built better.
3. Swap stations are relatively complex, that will need regular service, and likely need an attendant in addition to issues with where they are located. Charging stalls on the other hand, can be placed anyplace where you have sufficient electrical capacity. They can be put curb-side where people park their cars. There is no real need for dedicated land devoted to charging.
4. Newer EV batteries are faster to charge, making the time to charge versus swap a non-significant issue.

Think about it. For a given price point you can have a car that performs better, weighs less, and has more range versus getting a car with a swappable battery. If the concern is lack of places to charge, then the car with the swappable battery will still need to deal with swapping batteries more often then you charge. If the concern is that on a longer-range trip you don't want to waste time charging, well you still are dealing with less range to begin with, with a swappable battery.

Bottom line, both from a practical standpoint and a price standpoint, battery swapping is a dead-end. It might be necessary as a stop-gap, so possible room for Nio's solution for the time being, but just don't see it being a thing in a few years.

I am considering Puts for Jan 2022. My one concern is that I have no way to time when investors realize NIO's current approach is a dead-end. I would not think someone like Hindenburg will come in and trash them, since they are a legit company with a legit product. Rather, my issue is, the product is not going to be the success investors hope it will be.";wallstreetbets;2021-03-14 05:16:21

gquknvp;downtomylastpenny;1;"Hey Boys. I called $46 on Thursday and I have another prediction for this week. 

Sentiment seems to bullish as we saw the market reaction to the high (1.6%+) 10 yr yield Friday and Nasdaq made a strong rebound into close. Monday will be super strong green Monday, I see us closing $48.50+... if I get the chance (depending on any small dips intraday or early in the session) I‚Äôm loading up on $55 April 26th calls. But why you may ask? Well I‚Äôve done some research (took me 5 minutes) and there‚Äôs a lot of chatter about NIO closing on a huge deal with sinopec a battery charging station. And from what I am reading the first operating station will be launching 4/16. That being said, I believe (with my guessing and balls scratching) that NIO will announce this within the next week or 2.  Let‚Äôs face it, they are Chinese and when it comes to pumping they‚Äôre the best (coronavirus close 2nd). 
If you‚Äôre worried about the triple witching as I am on fridays end of session. I may be selling all my options early session Friday (when we pop at open) as we will probably be opening in the $54-56 range anyway. Then wait closer to end of day to buy all my options again (all in with my huge gains). 

We will see how this plays out and if my hunch is accurate.

gqqbwfa;ionized_fallout;-2;"03:47 PM EST, 03/12/2021 (MT Newswires) -- AMC Entertainment Holdings(AMC) was the most active among the most cited stocks on Reddit's wallstreetbets on Friday, with shares jumping 9% in afternoon trading on slightly lower volume.

The movie theater company, which has been under considerable financial pressure during the pandemic, released better-than-expected quarterly earnings on Wednesday. AMC also revealed it has now reopened 527 of its 589 US theaters.

Shares of GameStop(GME) , which has served as the center of the wallstreetbest universe for the last several weeks, were up 6% in late day trading on slightly lower volume.

Palantir (PLTR) , which has also been in play for some time on the subreddit, was trading largely flat. Volume was down from 86 million shares on Thursday to 50 million on Friday.

Forum regular Tesla (TSLA) saw its shares slip 2%, while BlackBerry (BB) shares climbed 9%.

Cannabis producer Aphria(APHA) was also back on Reddit radar screens Friday, with shares gaining 3%. Also attracting attention was Chinese EV maker Nio (NIO), with shares dipping 2%.

Elsewhere in the broader market, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 1% and the Nasdaq Composite Index eased 0.6%, while the S&amp;P 500 hugged the flatline.

gqq8ouq;ohboimemez;1;"I bought Ford at around $8 and I think it will double by the end of the year. 

Not from a fundamental analysis point but from their product launches I a as m bullish. 
Bronco,competes with wrangler and Will take some market share from Jeep. Raving reviews and segment is exploding. 
F150 is a big deal. Electric version coming soon 
Mach E great reviews and awesome build quality compared to Tesla. I love the tier approach with pricing ranging from $40k to $70k. This will help to get the shares from Tesla. Big auto know how to build different cars from the same line. 

NIO sold about 6k cars a month and is valued at 70B, Ford sold 2M cars a year and is value at 50B. In about 5 years, the big auto will be re-evaluated. 

This is not cellphone, the investment for auto manufacturing is astronomical compared to revamping a line for iPhone 11 to iPhone 12. There won‚Äôt be too many outsourced manufacturing for cars. Partnership, M&amp;A are the only viable models.

gqo14yu;TheRedditRef;1;"Lol I of course look at the companies fundamentals. I‚Äôve studied every subsidiary of JD from an accounting and risk standpoint. It‚Äôs been a stock position I‚Äôve held for over a year. 

My analysis integrates: Fundamentals, underlying value and ratios in comparison to its peers in it‚Äôs sector, consolidated SEC documentation of institutional purchases, short interest, institutional put to call ratio, graphical analysis compared to book growth, and it‚Äôs average option fundamentals. 

Why don‚Äôt you look at all my previous posts I‚Äôve made too? Every single position I‚Äôve posted about presented the opportunity for profit. I called PLUG and NIO before they were trading above 10 points. 

So out of the money options are technically worth nothing, and depending on IV and the underlying value of the stock are more or less expensive. OTM positions are much more volatile because you are paying for more contracts, but they have no value. It‚Äôs why they are cheaper, they have more risk. 

If you buy a 100 strike call on something trading at 80, everything you pay for is theoretical value, and that value decays as you approach the expiration date, represented by the negative coefficient theta. If you executed the contract and sold it when you bought it, you‚Äôd instantly lose money. It has no value. 

When you buy an OTM option, if the stock flattens or goes down you must overcome your strike price, premium cost, and your fighting theta decay. There are too many variables to not be able to hold, and you cannot hold OTM positions without posting large losses, nearly resetting your portfolio if you aren‚Äôt diversified. ITM positions don‚Äôt have decay. If JD is at 80 and you have a 60 strike call, if the stock price falls for two weeks to 75 the maximum you lose is 25%. On an OTM position you would probably be down 80%, and fighting more decay everyday. 

ITM positions protect you in the event the stock flattens, or if you need to hold for a long period of time because it will always hold its real value until it falls OTM. It‚Äôs really one google search away for you to confirm ITM options are less risk. 

I‚Äôve offered spreads examples, and good positions to sell too in the past, but people aren‚Äôt that interested, and most the ones that are want me to reach them. So I‚Äôve just strayed away from it.";wallstreetbets;2021-03-12 07:09:13

gqmw6be;Scrubbadubdoug;1;"If you have true conviction in your stock picks buying the dip isn't such a ""far out"" idea or memed saying as it's made out to be. The problem is so many people are buying into companies they *think* they're willing to hold for 3-5 years, yet when the market hits a bump that is thrown out the window and all they can think is how low it can go.

It's cliche but having a small, concentrated portfolio of what you know takes so much stress out of investing. I own shares in 5 companies and the rest of my portfolio is made up of VTI and some QQQ. After seeing NVDA plummet from $600/share to $500 to $450 that was a no brainer buy. PINS dropping from $90 to $65, no questions asked I'm scooping it up. These are great companies posting amazing numbers, they might be a little bloated but I have conviction that in 5 years they'll be worth more than today. However, I can't say the same for something like NIO or PLUG. I don't know enough about either or those industries to confidently but the dip.

Sorry for the rant, the TLDR is if you're invested in companies you know and *really* have confidence in then buying the dip is a no brainer and much easier to follow through with.";stocks;2021-03-12 00:19:25

On the one hand, there are the monsters like Tesla, NIO, BYD or Li, then there are the classic Asian carmakers like KIA or Hyundai that are well positioned in the EV segment but have brand problems or quality problems. Then there are all the European carmakers, especially the Germans. Daimler, Volkswagen or Renault, these stand for quality (especially the Germans, Renault rather less), reliability and catch up with the already mentioned monsters. 

Ford and GM build bad cars for over 100 years, apart from crap like a Mustang Mach-E they have nothing to show. If you don't go for Tesla and Co, why do you choose Ford or GM, when something like Volkswagen has 100000x more potential? I don't get it.";wallstreetbets;2021-03-11 18:39:43

gqki7pi;RichTannins;1;It‚Äôs silly. Hear the same argument for Tesla/NIO/whatever else has been discussed heavily on Reddit.  A company can 100% be evaluated. It‚Äôs how they do they business. They don‚Äôt wander into a new area of business without understanding every risk and potential to profit. People build models based of this information. Then they fuck with said models until they fully understand their position. And sure, they don‚Äôt always hold. But it‚Äôs why investors buy into a company. Not on some hope and whim and sheer speculation from Reddit, but on the ability to profit. The high and lows that move around that centered mean is just speculation. Everything straightens out over time. Overpriced companies come back to the mean. If you can ride the highs while it‚Äôs soaring, good on you.;stocks;2021-03-11 13:15:29

not saying the blue chip memes are bad. they're not. dis/fb/aapl are probably your safest bets of all the holding. but whats the point of holding in ARKK when you have PLTR, DKDNG, TSLA and AAPL?

gqj86w5;radarbot;4;"Sorry, I'm having a bit of a hard time following you. But if I understand correctly, this is what you mean:

1. When a stock reaches its 200 day moving average, bulls need to step in and defend it at that level. We should see increased buying to give the stock support.

2. When the stock falls below 200 day moving average, but is within 7-8% on the low side of the moving average, we have bulls and bears battling it. Bears will be selling, bulls will be buying. When there are more sellers thans buyers, the stock will plummet to below its 200 MA, maybe finding support at the last known support level. If there are more buyers, then expect the stock to rally back up to the 200MA.

Right now, NIO is sitting about 25% above the 200MA. If it falls, it could fall fast and hard, since its rise was so meteoric there aren't many support levels between 40 and 28. In December we had solid consolidation around $40, with a dip to $38 quickly being bought up. But since then, we've definitely seen NIO not sustain above $50.";stocks;2021-03-11 04:35:13

gqglavr;shakespear94;1;"There are multiple reasons for me to not invest long term in TSLA. It‚Äôs become a meme and quite frankly it is one of the only EV companies actively delivering in the US. This simply means one thing, competition is coming. Despite Elon Musk being a bold person, I can‚Äôt shake off the feeling that a ‚Äúmufasa effect will happen‚Äù. Lucid Motors has gone public, NIO is planning US launch... once COVID air clears, there might be even more initiatives from current big dogs to go full or all electric. I also foresee that gasoline/petrol/diesel powered vehicles are very much still alive... think construction, a very large part of an economic system, it cannot thrive without diesel and hydraulic fuels. TSLA does not manufacture these vehicles (or yet), and in order for it to tap that, it would require a helluva lot more mental and paper power. Volvo (an ugly long ticker that I don‚Äôt want to pull up in the AM), is pledging to go all electric by the next 5-10 years. Ford is having great success with Mustang Mach-E (even with a recent recall), and so the current big gasoline dogs have clearly begun making there moves.

This is why my child shall not have shares of TSLA. Yes it ‚Äúcan‚Äù go up, but the numbers don‚Äôt add up. If it goes to $100,000 per share, not a single atom in my body will be sad because we content with our decision now for the future.";stocks;2021-03-10 16:23:16

I did that yesterday since I was so red for the last 4 weeks being too bullish and not thinking about this.

gqfpgka;alexxs88;1;"Key is looking forward and anticipating to what level they can sustain the growth. The fact that they lost sales in February at the same time as Tesla gained a lot of sales should at least ring some alarm bells.

I was heavily invested in Tesla in 2019 and I own a company in the automotive field, my perspective is that Nio doesn't hold any serious competitive advantage to allow it to gain market share over its competitors and because it lacks its own factory, their gross margins are smaller. Also, a car company has finite room to grow in and they haven't shown any serious execution capability in any other fields. I might be wrong, just my senses tell me Nio is more show than go.";stocks;2021-03-10 11:42:55

gqfoij8;JustOnTheHorizon_;1;Personally I think it‚Äôs all relative. Nio is a new player, they‚Äôre still quite young in the game so currently it‚Äôs best to view and compare the growth (QoQ, YoY). February 2021 Nio did 6k cars, and last year February, they did 700 cars. That‚Äôs 700% YoY growth, and I think that‚Äôs incredibly appealing, and helps justify the premium. In comparison, Tesla had been around for almost two decades, so I think it‚Äôs a little more nuanced than just straight up comparing unit sales.;stocks;2021-03-10 11:29:30

Then after the pump, everyone calls everyone retards for not buying it. You're also forgetting there are retards that bought in late at $300-500 mark. They're screwed. The only thing they can possibly do is shill the stock like its gold.

What if tomorrow gamestop jumped to $300 tomorrow. Well, kudos. What if it dropped down to $50 again because someone with a million calls decided to finally take profit? Anything could happen. All I know is putting $10 on amc and watching it drop to like $5 is fine to me rather than buying gamestop at $237 right now and dropping back to $150. I'm not one of those that buys multiple lottery tickets. I buy just one and watch to see what happens. What's my position, you wonder? $12 call in AMC expires in january.

I'm trying to help you here! You might get lucky and make some money with your investing style but it would be just that, luck. Do you know how to value a company? How do you choose what is a fair price for a stock and what is expensive. How do you assess what risk premium is adequate for your personal risk tolerance and conditions? Maybe I'm wrong but to me it sounds like you are just going with your feels. For example NIO, electric vehicles will be huge, NIO can grow significantly and capture a significant chunk of the EV market. Or can it? How did you assess that? And even if that wpuld be the case and NIO gets even 50% of global EV market (bullshit), what would be a fair price at these conditions? Is it worth chasing short-term profits in already overvaluated stocks when you can go for low risk steady growth options and have time playing in your favour? Those are questions only you can answer. Its all up to you, of course. Maybe i am wrong about you but i think that if you want to do individual stocks, perhaps you should spend couple more years just playing around with your own money (perhaps couple of grand?) that you don't need for anything.

If I was you, i would look at stocks that have a very steady value. ie, their beta is close to 1. That way, you're not just gambling. Cause right now, I'd say that you should put your money in ETFs and only invest in stocks with dividends because if you aren't researching the shit out of any companies, then you're pretty much gambling.   


For the most part, Cannabis companies may grow, but look at any company and their finances are garbage. I can't find one company that has good finances that is in the weed business.   


That's my advice because if you're a beginner, get out of anything that is BB/AMC/GME/PLTR/Weed/EV/NIO/TSLA. Don't buy anything at the ATH. Just don't. There's always pullback.";stocks;2021-03-09 13:34:46

gqbmjar;nautilus1982;1;"I agree with your first point. NIO is fairly successful at their target customers and they are not failing. My point is, one does not become the fifth largest carmaker in the world and the biggest in China (by market cap) selling just 50,000 cars a year to the US$50,000-70,000 segment in China. Even at today's reduced price, it is still over-valued. 

BMW, on the other hand, is penetrating China very well. They sold 777,000 cars last year (nearly 18 times NIO's number). In the premium segment, a luxury brand serves as a status symbol and the Germans (BMW, Mercedes, Audi) dominate the Chinese market. Sure they don't have competitive EVs yet, but I don't see an unsurmountable technological hurdle here (unlike NOKIA vs iPhone), in fact BMW built the i3 before NIO was even established. They have good EV tech, it is only a matter of time before German brands come up with competitive products, and by then they will eat into NIO's market.

I guess I should explain my point on BaaS a bit more clearly: I am not saying there are no battery changing stations. The problem is, in Beijing, near where I and my ES8-owning friend live, the station is always full in normal hours, with at least 4 to 5 customers queuing. Each would take 8-10 minutes to swap, Furthermore, the stations usually don't have enough fully-charged batteries in stock, due to cost and space concerns. So what usually happens is that the battery from a previous customer hasn't finished re-charging, so you have to wait an extra 10-30 minutes.  All in all,  it takes about an hour on average to have battery replaced (this is my friend's experience), far from the 'get there and have everything done in 5 minutes' claim on paper. 

For relatively small sales, the stations are still manageable. But as more people buy NIO cars, they will get more and more crowded. To maintain reasonable customer service NIO will need to build many more battery stations and keep a big inventory of batteries, plus all the human costs. Now that is much much more costly than building charging points/stations, and NIO is claiming to provide the service for free to early adopters and a minimal cost to new customers. You mentioned NIO's operating loss, well, the fact is that NIO recently span off BaaS as a separate business (called NIO Power), because it is massively unprofitable, with no prospect of turning green any time soon. Instead of trimming their operating loss, BaaS makes their financial report look even worse.

I appreciate Tesla's contribution of spearheading the EV revolution, but I am not big fan of their products. I think Tesla too is over-valued, perhaps less so than NIO. But then the market doesn't really corroborate to fundamentals, so I must admit there are money to be made by speculating on their stocks, though that's just...speculation.";stocks;2021-03-09 12:59:37

\*\*\*  
There's just one tiny little thingy... Ford, VW, etc... their EVs suck. Half-baked tech. Terrible range. Top range? Tesla. NIO claims to beat Tesla at this with ET7, but who knows if it's true or not. The most important thing in a EV? Range. Even Tesla is barely there yet, you have to charge overnight, at your suburban house with a garage, but what if you live in an apartment, like most city-dwellers do? Well... too bad. Because if it loses all charge, the battery is damaged. When the shift from nokia to smartphones happened, I was furious, the damn battery only works for a single day, whaaat? Many years later, the battery is still a joke. 

Making a breakthrough in a couple of short years is going to be tough for companies which are specializing in explosive gas and combustion chambers. Now they have to make computers with wheels. Sure, they are hiring data analysts and battery specialists and user interface designers now. But it takes a good, experienced team about 3-4 years to develop a complex software product, and sometimes after 3 years experienced teams fail. Imagine for a second: so Chevron decides, fuck it, crude is so last year, let's dethrone Apple and wipe this ugly fruit logo from the face of the planet for good, we're going after PC and handheld markets, we have billions in our coffers, entire countries in our pockets, half of Congress is ours, we can assassinate Steve Jobs himself if need be, what can possibly stop us?

gq8ej0b;JustOnTheHorizon_;1;Thanks for the comment. Firstly, I never once said that Nio was dominated the Chinese market or whatever like Tesla does. Everyone knows that. There‚Äôs other players in China for sure, it‚Äôs not like america at all. Yeah NIO‚Äôs appeal is in the upper middle class, that‚Äôs literally their target audience as a business? Sounds like they‚Äôre doing a decent job so far to me since that‚Äôs their goal. On your point about the ES8, you question it‚Äôs sales but you literally have no explanation why? If you‚Äôre saying consumers wouldn‚Äôt buy that over the BMW, I don‚Äôt see BMW penetrating the Chinese market really? I will concede that the premium market does need some growth, especially when NIO‚Äôs operating losses haven‚Äôt been slimmed down a whole lot. However, I think that NIO‚Äôs other ventures like BaaS and the packages stated at the beginning do fill some of that gap. As for the ES8‚Äôs handling, I can‚Äôt really comment on that because I don‚Äôt have first hand experience. But as for your point on privacy concern, welcome to China? Have you heard of Huawei? Pretty sure they‚Äôre doing alright. Also I would encourage your friend to retry the ‚Äòjoke and slow charging infrastructure‚Äô. It‚Äôs on record and verified to swap batteries in three minutes? Doesn‚Äôt seem slow to me. (4) What is NIO‚Äôs core competitiveness? Nio is trying to differentiate themselves from other Chinese EV‚Äôs and not just be the next Tesla or whatever. Tesla had very solid brand recognition and their own style, and Nio knows this. So instead of trying to dethrone musk like other EV companies waste money doing, Nio is trying to carve their own market with the BaaS and premium/upper middle class/ consumer relations. I would swing back around to the strategy part of the DD. Also again I have to concede because you make a really fair point about GM, the valuation there is a little fuzzy. But to get in this kind of EV market, there is undoubtedly a premium, that‚Äôs just how it‚Äôs turned out to be. You seem to be a fan of Tesla, they‚Äôd be an example of how the EV market has a premium. Thanks again for the comment, I appreciate hearing the other side.;stocks;2021-03-08 17:40:22

gq8bg4y;Fudgeddaboudit;1;Building factories is a financial liability. Not sure, if their decision to essentially rent a factory is the right choice, but do you know it is the wrong one? Time will tell, I suppose. But, to play the devil's advocate, NIO not building their own factories helps their cash flow. I'm not sure if they pay for each car manufactured, or give a share of profits when one is sold, but they don't have massive debt because of owning factories at their young age. Tesla was extremely close to bankruptcy a few times, due to cash problems. They obviously survived, but NIO is probably trying to avoid that.;stocks;2021-03-08 17:19:28

gq830b1;nautilus1982;1;"I also posted most of the following in another thread, but thought it may be useful here:

This DD is so generic it applies to almost any EV maker in China (apart from maybe the BaaS part), yet no one is talking about these companies here.

NIO is not dominating the Chinese market as TESLA does the US market, nor is it likely to. It sold 43,738 EVs in 2020, making it only the 8th largest EV manufacturer in China, trailing Tesla, Wuling, BYD, SAIC, GAC, Great Wall and Chery. Now that's not bad for a start-up. Dozens of new EV makers sprang up in China in recent years, most have gone bust. NIO is among the few serious contenders and I‚Äôm sure it will survive, its sales may even go up. I am just not convinced that it is well-positioned to maintain its edge in the segment:

(1) NIO fills a particular niche: If you do not have a licence to buy petrol cars (e.g. in Beijing) but need a large SUV, then until recently NIO ES8 and ES6 were your only options. My high school mate bought an ES8 in 2018 for that reason, but he said he would either downgrade to Tesla Model Y or upgrade to Jaguar I-PACE/Mercedes EQC if he were in the market in 2021. 

NIO's appeal remains in the metropolitan upper middle class. Unlike Tesla, it does not have a budget offering. Tesla Model 3 retails for US$38,324 in China, the cheapest NIO, the EC6, starts at US$54,206, the ES8 is close to US$70,000. NIO also seems to be upholding the 'premium' image. They just released a BMW 7 series competitor (EP7), now seriously, how many people are going to buy it? As premium brands start to get serious with EV, competition in this segment is going to be brutal. Other Chinese carmakers are also going upmarket (e.g. Geely's Lynk &amp; CO., Great Wall's WEY brand). NIO is going to feel the squeeze, from both above and below. It will have a hard time just to hold it's current position. If they continue their current strategy they are going to miss the budget segment, where most of the sales are. The premium market is just not big enough to warrant its current valuation.

(2) A lot of hype is built on paid-marketing materials. I wish people had the chance to actually test-drive their cars. I test-drove my friend‚Äôs ES8, the handling is horrible, it feels like a hurried and unfinished product. How is it going to be competitive against, say Jaguar I-PACE or Mustang Mark E, if it were ever released in Western markets? Their AI assistant, with over a dozen in-car cameras and mics streaming everything back to NIO is going to a massive privacy concern.

(3) Their ‚Äòcharging infrastructure‚Äô remains a joke, even in big cities such as Beijing. They send a petrol-powered truck carrying batteries to charge your vehicle, seriously? Please tell me where I can replace the battery within a matter of minutes, because my school mate, a ES8 owner, really wants to know.

(4) What is NIO's core competitiveness? They do not own factories, do not build batteries, and their technologies are nothing to write home about. Their autonomous driving is far behind Tesla and not that competitive even to other Chinese carmakers.

Is NIO, which produced less than 50,000 cars last year, worth more than GM? Well, this is not even the biggest hype. Evergrande, another new Chinese EV maker, has a market cap of 68 billion USD (530 billion HK$) at the Hong Kong stock exchange, and guess what, they have sold 0, yes, ZERO cars so far.

I can see why people are jumping on the bandwagon and the hype will probably keep going for a while. It‚Äôs just that NIO‚Äôs long term potential and valuation may not be as rosy as it seems.";stocks;2021-03-08 16:20:18
