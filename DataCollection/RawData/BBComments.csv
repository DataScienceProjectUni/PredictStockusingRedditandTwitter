gr7qmyq;Techno__Violet;1;"But the shorts are not significant for any special reason. The huge financial firms shorting AMC are doing it because a room full of professionals decided it was a profitable play. 

GME is special due the sheer magnitude of how much of it is shorted, and the questionable reporting with institutional investors reporting 115% of total shares ever issued, among other factors that are beyond my understanding. 

My hypothesis is that BB, NOK, and partially AMC came into play because they were all heavily shorted, and much more affordable than GME at the ""tipping point"" when GME first exploded and there was an influx of millions of users/traders buying in late game, and to the novice trader - buying 100 shares of a $4 stock is more psychologically satisfying than buying two shares of a $200 stock. 

The human dimension drives this whole train, not reason or logic. GME is the only legitimate player here (squueze business) and it is not guaranteed to do anything.

If I get knocked down to zero it's going my to be too hard to climb back up. 20k is probably nothing to many of you
 It's certainly nothing it to HF.

gr584z8;donedrone707;9;"What you need to understand about blackberry is that if they fired all of their employees and sat on their asses for the next five years they'd still make hundreds of millions just off their patents 
Blackberry was the precursor to the modern smartphone  and holds a lot of patents on smartphone tech that are still relevant and will be for some time. 

But they aren't stupid. They knew they were done in the smartphone landscape when their clicky touchscreen phone launched in like 2010? Idk it was that big thing and when you pushed the screen it clicked down. Apparently it sucked, I never had one. 
But anyway, they learned from their mistake and instead invested in what they saw to be some of the next big developments in tech and innovation: namely cyber security, autonomous vehicles, smart cities, etc.

I met a BB recruiter in 2016 at a job fair that gave me the best free pen I've ever received and told me how BB was trying to shift their public perception from a defunct smartphone maker to a cyber security firm.

""Make your money now folks, cause this won't be happening again or at least viable through the stock market"". Now the market will be entering a 30's like move, no money to be made I guess. Does anyone agree or disagree to this? Eh, it's a damn shame really :

Disagree -- bearish sentiment has always plagued markets. Generally what actually precedes bearish moves are poor innovations relative to market gains -- think dot com bubble - none of those sites were innovative or at least the vast majority of them. 2008-2009 crash was (in highly summarized form) preceded by Mortgage Backed Securities and suddenly everyone was able to buy a 1/2 $M house.

Last year, EVs finally became funded and able to be taken seriously -- so seriously new regulations are out for the transition. Teleworking became available to MANY MANY more people. Telemedicine too. Wallets are going digital. Cable is a joke. Arts and artists are getting financial value for their work via new platforms that are also being taken seriously (Pinterest, Etsy). Freelance workers have several platforms to choose from (Fiverr / Upwork).

Finally, GME / AMC / BB saga was a pivotal David &amp; Goliath moment between retail investors vs. institutional investors. There's finally a new tool in town for the little guy. The big players have always used this along with sophisticated software etc.. but we're seeing how powerful shared information is -- and we're going to be a better world because of it.

https://www.tradingview.com/chart/?symbol=NYSE%3AGME

Open up trading view and play with the charts a bit.

Click on f(x) indicator and then enable some of the built in ones.

Best DD is the ones you do yourself and see with your own eyes. Use the DD to help guide you.

If you want to see the OBV (On-balance Volume) that some of DD here has been talking about you can compare GME OBV to another ticker like TSLA of AAPL.

You will see some something interesting.

Edit: Back on my computer now.

GME - On-balance Volume

https://www.tradingview.com/x/9yLEeJ3Y/

AMC - On-balance Volume

https://www.tradingview.com/x/3pHrcxuC/

APHA - On-balance Volume

https://www.tradingview.com/x/4WxQP15t/

RKT - On-balance Volume

https://www.tradingview.com/x/e4ImTO5F/

BB - On-balance Volume

https://www.tradingview.com/x/hJ7n0wHg/

TSLA - On-balance Volume

Notice the difference?

Price dropping on GME doesn't flow volume flow.

$GME is an anomaly. Even compared to $RKT $AMC $ANAL

That was the scene with Ryan Gossling pitch (with the jenga blocks) the AAA were on the top and B on the bottom. What caused the subprime mortgage crisis are rating agencies and banks being greedy, as much as i support capitalism i think the government should rate the bonds here is why: If you are greedy banker (and they were/are) you can put let's say 20bonds in a package (CDO, synthetic CDO) and the package could have 3 AAA bonds, 7 AA, 10 BBB, 5BB, 5B if you have good relations with rating agency (or if you bribe them) you can get AAA or AA score on your CDO and sell it to big banks or hedge funds for good premium because they're safe bonds and they need some safe cash flow.

The rating agency is key point in the financial crisis, sure everyone was speculating but if they were giving fair grades nobody would've been so greedy to sell as much mortgage bonds to people who couldn't afford to pay.

Tldr: use what you would have spent on the donation to buy then donate 10x with tendie gains once the war is won.

gr298fa;Bull_Winkle69;-14;"I bought in at 194 so my sentiment on today is a bit different than yours.

I sold 50 of my 95 shares at 230. I just had to lower my risk profile. I already lost 20k on palantor and bb buying at the top. Still holding 500 shares of nok for sentimental reasons. Even my 200 shares of fubo has been in the red until today.

I'm hoping gme goes back up, but I just can't ride it down like before and take anymore losses.

I'll try to buy and sell the dips with this new liquidity and keep a few shares with the profits.

I've set up some limit orders close enough to the top to be triggered by another short attack but far enough that a gradual decline like today will give me time to remove them.

I'll buy their dip at several levels and when it pops back up I'll sell some of them to break even and keep the rest. I want to keep my share price below 40 since that seems like the floor to me.";wallstreetbets;2021-03-15 22:31:38

gr269ts;almostabumbull;1;BB is a tech company with some pretty decent products. Problem with them is they are always struggling with legacy assets losing revenue. It used to be a favorite punching bag. Revenue was declining from hardware for years making it look a bit bad with a quick look at the financials. Many people worry that new products won't be able to counter revenue declines from IP licencing revenue declines. Ivy was a big step in assuring that this shouldn't be the case. Thing is look at the potential it has. I know they have lots of competition across the board, but damn those smart city patents are a hint that gets me tingly. They are also transitioning to be more amicable in regards to being used with other products. I truly believe in this company.

Whether you are right or not, this post reads like a pep-talk for those holding BB and getting anxious.I'm long 800 shares BB and we'll see what happens, for the coming 10 years my assessment is:  
\-Expected IRR, assuming same fundamentals: 20% at $8, 14% at $12, 10% at $15  
\-IRR totally dependent on BB turning weak historical performance around and growing significantly in 2021/2022.  
\-Turnaround is visible in TTM numbers 25-Feb 2021, uncertain whether it will continue into 2021 &amp; 2022.  
\-High uncertainty with high upside if they grow and multiple converges towards a cheap B2B Software company.  
\-Mid Core, Very High Risk  
\-HOLD

When it hits $20-30 this year they better be showing significant reduction in risk, or significant additional upside. If not I'll be selling until it normalizes again (or not).

gr1a0yo;SubstantialSail;1;"If you plan on holding for a long time, you should average down if the price is holding steady like BB did once it tanked from the meme jump. Example: If you bought in 100 shares at $25, then bought another 100 at $8, suddenly you've got 200 shares with an average cost of $16.5. If you buy 200 shares at $8, now it's $13.58 average cost. It will take forever to so much as break even at a $25 average cost, but averaging down means you can exit sooner, or just make more as it goes up.

This helps you in long-term game because now you're only -$5.58 a share rather than -$17. It also means if you're going to sell call options your basis is significantly lower for a less risky strike price or a strike price that generates larger premiums (you'd only be getting $18 premium for a $25 1APR2021 call versus $54 for a $15.50 1APR2021 call).

gr18wvz;rgar132;1;"Nice DD.... But automotive is my day job, and I won‚Äôt invest a penny in Ford unless it‚Äôs buying a put when the stock runs up a bit.   Much better bets in GM, Stellantis, Toyota, even Rivian or even better growth out of some of the smaller and medium sized tier 1‚Äôs.  The tier 1‚Äôs are an interesting perspective as they develop and industrialize a lot of the technology that is eventually deployed on a vehicle, and often sell to multiple oem‚Äôs.   The oem‚Äôs do a lot as well for their platform technology, but a good bet is to look into who they‚Äôre partnering with on a specific technology that interests you, and invest in the patent holder or tier 1 who‚Äôs bringing the technology to market.   Look at FCA‚Äôs 8 and 9 speed transmissions that have been very successful.... They bought the design from Zed F.   BB is doing a lot of the electronics now which is the bull case for them.   Bosch does sensoring, others will do AI and lidar if you like those techs.   Battery tech and assembly if you‚Äôre into EV‚Äôs.  Most of the traditional oem‚Äôs are so huge, entrenched and inefficient that they struggle to innovate, and use the supply base to do so.   They‚Äôre lucky to get a vehicle designed and built on time in many cases.

Honestly I hope I‚Äôm wrong and Ford does well, I really do, but man they are one messed up company and it runs deep.   I hope to eat these words and watch them turn things around, but I‚Äôm not holding my breath.   They‚Äôve got a lot of risk invested in the all aluminum f150, hinging on commodity prices.   With the cost of aluminum expected to increase they could seriously cripple their main cash cow.   Maybe buy some Alcoa as a hedge if you do go deep into Ford.";wallstreetbets;2021-03-15 17:34:42

gqzpngh;Shwiftygains;1;"See, i gotta believe part of you is triggered because you still miss my point. I never once said egaming isnt a valid industry or that there isnt skill required for it. 

But as a kinesiology major that grew up playing video games with arcades, consoles, and pc, im sorry but it just doesnt compare to actual sports. Are egamers pulling 2 a days in the spring heat with gear on for conditioning? Are they running hour long suicides at the gym for cardio? Are they running shooting drills for wrestling to beat their opponent physically.. As an athlete? Or are they doing standard exercises and workout regiments you can find at BB . com?

Just because they train doesn't mean they're athletes. If you join the military, you have to train in boot camp. To be an astronaut you have to be incredibly fit and healthy. Does it make them athletes? 

Shoot, firemen have to go through serious training, they have to remain very fit, and actually have competitions with their training drills. I would definitely consider firemen athletes long before i considered egamers

There is such a thing as being in football shape, being in basketball shape, being in soccer shape. Can you honestly tell me you have to exercise to get into gamer shape? Or can you be physically unfit and still be professionally ranked and sponsored? Maybe those top competitors have the common sense that staying fit and healthy is generally positive in your overall life with boosted benefits in all aspects of your life?

Again, i never questioned the legitimacy of egaming or the great skill and dedication required by gamers to compete. Not to mention the massively growing popularity. But really dont kid yourself. If all it takes to be considered an athlete is to lift and hold a damn controller, then we have reached the sport equivalent of a participation trophy. But maybe I'm not looking at it properly. If we're talking about esports, then being called e-athletes is more accurate and i could accept that. Doesnt make them athletes in rl";wallstreetbets;2021-03-15 07:46:25

gqz0xjj;AAces_Wild;1;Yeah there are some good videos out there. Basically, selling covered calls allows you to earn a guaranteed premium for selling a call, which gives someone else the right to buy 100 of your BB shares at a certain price. Selling a OTM Call for next month would get you some good premium, and you keep all the gains up to the strike. The downside is you give up your shares if the stock price is at the strike you sell to someone else on or before the expiration date.;wallstreetbets;2021-03-15 02:28:24

gqyv721;Jim-Kool-Aid-Jones;1;"Great write up!  Definitely a solid basis for a pile of optimism.  Honestly I don't know how AMC could be positioned better.  My concern with AMC is their propensity to increase stock.  I get that they had to do something due to the pandemic, but I don't think they can really do that again any time soon.  Neither do I believe they will. 

GME is just insane no matter how one looks at it.  I am a full retard so this isn't advice but it appears to my novice eyes that GME has three way phenomena happening: Short Squeeze, Gamma Squeeze and the X variable of a massive retail following who is literally buying everything GME, no matter the price.  I don't see that changing especially considering the influx of stimmy payments hitting retail investors banks even now. 

I don't know about RKT.  I have some but I just don't have enough verified info to make an educated guess.  I believe OP is right though. 

BB is one of my favorites.  I have a mountain of BB stock and have had it for months.  I think the EV variable for them is going to shoot it into the stratosphere.  Maybe I am wrong but it sure smells and looks good.  

I am trying to edumicate myself about the ramifications of the 3/5/21 DTCC proposed rule.  Where are the wiggly angles for HFs etc to wriggle their way out of it.  There has to be a couple. At first glance it looks like a great change for our stonks but again, my novice brain just figured out what the hell a ""Put"" is last week....so F-Me if I have any confidence of my interpretation(s) of the ramifications for this rule.  TO THE INTERNETZ!! 

Thanks OP for the great write up.  I do like all of these stocks.  I especially like games and movies and I would love to grab an EV and know it has the latest greatest tech built in.  hehe

One of the big websites that rank high short interest stocks made a mistake and put AMC instead of AMCX, which was the one that was actually shorted, and still is. But I think it'll still build and moon off of hype/impulse/online movement/stimulus. 

I think BB will get a little bit of action, but not as much as AMC and GameStop. GameStop will still be the king of volatility this week for sure. IV is too high for my liking, so I'm not playing it. 

Depending on the Fed's policies this week, RKT will either make or break.

I bought a contract for $850ish (8.50 per share) and exercised the contract letting me buy those shares for an additional $1 each for a total of $950 spent.

gqtw2o8;BrofLong;1;"You collect a premium up front for selling the contract. This money is yours to keep regardless if the 100 shares are sold or not (ideally, you won't have to sell, so you just get the premium). If the option gets exercised, then you sell your 100 shares at a set price, which should be profitable if the set price is higher than your purchase price (for example, if you set the price at $12 and bought your 100 shares at $10, then you make $200 profit from selling at $12 and buying at $10, plus whatever the premium upfront was). 

Most platforms will not let you sell naked calls without substantial collateral, since your loss potential is infinite (a stock price can rise without limit, in theory). So you may earn a premium up front, but the stock price can jump so much that your losses far exceeds your earnings.

For example, let's assume you sold a naked call of $BB at $12 and received a $100 premium up front, and currently, $BB is at $10. As long as it stayed below $12 up to expiration, you are okay. Let's say some catalyst event occurred and $BB jumped to $20 however. You are suddenly in trouble if the option buyer exercises - you must now purchase 100 shares at $20 (costing you $2000) and sell it at the agreed price of $12 (netting you $1200). So between the premium and the money you make ($1300), you lose $700 at the end of the day. Had you instead sold a covered call, you would have made $200 from the sale and $100 from the premium, for a total of +$300 instead. The difference is that in the covered example, you had to put in an initial $1000 investment. In the naked example, you put in nothing other than proof that you can buy the 100 shares, if needed. So institutions like banks and market makers can sell naked calls every week based on their extensive collateral, knowing they'd make money 'for free' as long as no catalyst events cause a big price jump. 

But this is why sold naked calls are dangerous - you get money most of the time without any issue, but a catalyst event can really put you in the deep end quick. The GME spike recently is not about naked calls, but I'm sure more than a few people lost tons of money selling naked calls due to the price spike.";stocks;2021-03-13 20:06:22

gqtuueq;The_Texidian;1;"Investing in trends and innovation almost never works out in the long run. 

It seems like a great idea due to the survivorship bias. We only look at companies that survived, but we ignore the multitude that failed. 

Example: Dot-Com bubble. We look at Microsoft and Apple which survived and grew to be huge. We ignore the hundreds of other companies we could‚Äôve picked that failed. 

Example that isn‚Äôt dotcom related: Car companies. Certainly we can look to GM and Ford as a massive success, but we ignore the many many many car companies that were promising but ultimately failed. 

Example: Phones. Back in the early 2000s Blackberries was the shizzz man. Every executive had one. Nobody saw the iPhone coming. If you had bought BB stock, well, you‚Äôd be hurt bad after a huge run up.

As of the time I wrote this a $20 call on BB expiring March 19th sells for $13 (the price of options is calculated per share so in this case $0.13 but each contract is 100 shares =$13 per contract). which doesn't seem like much but over the course of a year adds up.

I went crazy and yoloed it all in GME, AMC, BB, and NOK. Ended up like 40K down and the combination of the other market that shall not be named in this sub, and my very thinly paper hands, I sold. Thank god I invested what was left in the market that shall not be named and now I'm richer than I've ever been.

I'm so sad I missed the second rally, I'm a longtime crayon eating ape and will be for life, but will forever remember by paper hands blunder.

I really hope GME reaches a 10000 and all my fellow apes make 100 the money I've made in the past month. It will be bittersweet, but definitely more sweet than bitter.

gqs1scs;UncleZiggy;1;"I agree and disagree. I would say most of TA is voodoo witchcraft, or whatever you want to call it. But there are some components that technically fit into TA that are really critical to know.

I'll give some examples of important ones:

1) **Option chains**

Most stocks do not have a significant number of options at different strike levels. The ones that typically do these days are the ones that get popular and then are deemed as 'meme stocks'. Because of the increase of public focus, more people pile in thus the stock becomes volatile, particularly when the company that is being invested is a smaller market cap company or has good potential, but issues in the balance sheet. Thus, the influx of longs will also produce a number of shorts, and voila, volatility. If you can figure out when a stock is going to become volatile, or which will stay volatile, it is possible to use TA to find out when to buy, which can make you a lot of money.

A popular example is GME. This is not just a popular example, but really a rather unparalleled example, a stock that has 10s of thousands of options at 'nice number' strikes, such as 150, 200, 250, 300, etc. Earlier this week (or was it last?), I personally *knew* about the large number of options at 150. I knew that just based on the math alone, the TA that is, if GME crosses 150, it would probably get to 180 or even 200 within the day. So I woke up at 4am PST bought 100 shares and within a few hours I had 25% returns. Just took some investigation into TA.

*I'm really not a TA guy, FYI. But I do use a few TA tools and ignore the rest*

2) Insider buys and sells

Perhaps this is borderline FA and TA, but I'm going to call this TA for this reason. Sometimes a stock is undervalued, and for whatever reason, it just sits being undervalued for a long time. If an insider, or an exec, starts buying shares a certain price, or if multiple people start buying shares, that's an insider floor. Usually means that a *really* nice place to be, because they know a lot more than you do, and if they're happy with that price point, then so am I. For instance, a number of insiders bought shares of BB right at the 10.00 price, creating a floor for a little while at 10. Ultimately, it dipped below and came back, but either way, that little piece of TA tells me that anytime BB gets near 10, it's a good buying opportunity. Of course, I like the fundamentals of BB a lot more than just going off the TA, but it does help reinforce your own opinions.

3) 200MA vs 50MA

This one can be significant, and sometimes it's not so significant. It really depends on how often these averages cross and how strongly they have crossed. Finding a company that actually reverses it's business outlook from a negative one to a positive one is rare, and if you can identify a company that might be trending in a better direction, look more into that company! This was the initial thesis behind DFV's look into GME, and in fact, a lot of popular stocks on Reddit have been focusing on turn around stories. It can make you a pretty penny

There's not a lot else that I really think holds a lot of worth in TA, but that's just my opinion. I think everyone should have different values on how to value stocks and interpret how a company will do. There's no need for solidarity!";stocks;2021-03-13 07:12:47

Mostly MVIS because its current valuation is up 20% today on literally hopes and dreams and a cash burn so bad that they diluted shares in two offerings in jan and feb so that they wouldn't go bankrupt for the next couple years.... and the cash burn is only $5m

They closed Monday at $11.77, they closed today at \~$17.50 off a slight ""earnings"" miss (I put it in quotes because they don't earn shit compared to the valuation). I'm really only about 20% of my portfolio in but that's pretty fucking all in for a weekly play if ya ask me, multiple $16P and $15P.  2/1/21 they were up to $7.21 a share, a whopping 300% increase from 12/1/20.

gqrv8xm;Ihavenotseen;1;"If the strike price of a call is above the share price, it most likely won't be executed. So the option expires worthless, meaning the buyer lost the premium and the seller keeps it.

So as a example, you sell a call at a $20 strike at a premium of $0.50 that expires March 26th. At the end of the day on the 26th, BB is trading at $17. The buyer doesn't exercise their option buy the seller's 100 shares at $20, so it expires and you keep the $0.50 premium, which $0.50 * 100, means you earn $50.

The seller can buy to close their sold option before the expiration date to avoid selling shares at the strike or to secure profits.";stocks;2021-03-13 05:39:37

We lay poolside, do going, ordering drinks. She comes up to the room and we have amazing sex on the round couch in the corner of the room. Later that day we go to the Asian restaurant downstairs and go for round 2 that night. If I ever end up in a Groundhog Day scenario I pray it‚Äôs that day.

gqrayjs;Scooter_McCabe;1;"I'm looking at a bunch of possibilities and it's maddening.

AMC:  Did good for me today.  Analysts are against it, but NYC just reopened.  LA is reopening.  Sort of the redheaded step child right now with GME being the golden child.  Dare I buy calls in the face of possibly trading flat at 11 all next week?

GME:  Great news over the past weeks.  Great management coming in.  Surged like a son of a bitch back from 40.  Stimulus checks coming out and Hedge funds haven't figured out to leave this one alone.  But it's expensive.  I mean I don't have the cash for options.  It would eat up most of my stimmy check buying a few shares, but it's another Ape in the take over of the planet.

Ford:  Bullish good news with the EV.  Chipped into Tesla.  Rinky dink recall of 2.9 million cars for air bag inflator.  It's right there at it's 52 week high.  So does the mo carry this sucker over 14 bucks.  Or does the ""bad news"" and being near its high make it a juicy target and puts are the play?

BB:  So the EV news with Ford was cool.  BB worked with Ford and Jag for a time so there is a relationship there.  Ford owned Jag for a minute back in the day.  So why is that important?  Well Tesla is probably doing their stuff all in house, Ford will probably reach out to BB again.  Ford has been chipping away at Tesla too in the EV market.  So Ford and BB rise and fall together?

TESLA:  692 feels cheap to me.  I never got into the whole Elon thing.  But I listened to a few interviews and appearances on Joe Rogan.  He's an impressive idea machine that can sell the idea.  So yeah I can see it rising again over the next few months.  Also that spin off is going to be ridiculous.";wallstreetbets;2021-03-13 02:04:03

gqqjyv0;AstroidSeenByDinos;1;"Question here:

Why is BB rising again?


So BB rose this year because of not only good news, including a partnership with Amazon and patents, but also it was somewhat mixed in the Meme stock craze but not as much as GME or AMC. So when that bubble burst, BB corrected itself back to what it was before the Meme craze, right? So this week the second round of Meme rises happened, but BB was only seeing a few percent gains, compared to GME which rose dozens of percent. Now today we see BB up 13% while GME is up 2%. Even though I've been trading for 4 years, im still a noob and am just hoping someone can explain this new rise. Also, im guessing its going to fall back off in a few days and this is obviously temporary. Thanks for your time.";stocks;2021-03-12 21:54:27

gqqbwfa;ionized_fallout;-2;"03:47 PM EST, 03/12/2021 (MT Newswires) -- AMC Entertainment Holdings(AMC) was the most active among the most cited stocks on Reddit's wallstreetbets on Friday, with shares jumping 9% in afternoon trading on slightly lower volume.

The movie theater company, which has been under considerable financial pressure during the pandemic, released better-than-expected quarterly earnings on Wednesday. AMC also revealed it has now reopened 527 of its 589 US theaters.

Shares of GameStop(GME) , which has served as the center of the wallstreetbest universe for the last several weeks, were up 6% in late day trading on slightly lower volume.

Palantir (PLTR) , which has also been in play for some time on the subreddit, was trading largely flat. Volume was down from 86 million shares on Thursday to 50 million on Friday.

Forum regular Tesla (TSLA) saw its shares slip 2%, while BlackBerry (BB) shares climbed 9%.

Cannabis producer Aphria(APHA) was also back on Reddit radar screens Friday, with shares gaining 3%. Also attracting attention was Chinese EV maker Nio (NIO), with shares dipping 2%.

Elsewhere in the broader market, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 1% and the Nasdaq Composite Index eased 0.6%, while the S&amp;P 500 hugged the flatline.

gqq3xc7;bigguccisosaxx;1;"You use your own shares to sell a call and collect a premium. For example you can sell a covered all for BB at strike price $14. You get premium right away but if BB goes to $14 or above it's likely the buyer will exercise the option and you will have to sell them those shares for $14 (you still keep the premium though). Then you can either wait until expiry and do it again or you can buy your call back any time before that if you see it's cheaper than what you sold it for. You make less but your shares are available again. 

My cost basis for BB is $13 so I don't care if BB somehow magically reaches $14 since I would sell it for that price anyway.

Out of all the options stuff, covered calls are the ones that I recommend getting into.";stocks;2021-03-12 19:47:24

gqpvr5t;Core_S;2;"&gt;Heads up, autists... the resurgence of Blackberry is beginning. $BB stock has jumped over 20% from last Friday's low and broke through multi-month resistance. Why is it starting to run? the reason is that it‚Äôs a solid post-COVID recovery play.  
&gt;  
&gt;The company‚Äôs recent movement comes largely from the announcement by the US President Joe Biden that electric vehicles (EV) ‚Äì and other green energy initiatives ‚Äì will see massive investment worth billions of dollars. Even better, President Biden stated he would be changing 650,000 federal vehicles into EVs.

gqpbcl0;harrison_wintergreen;1;"partly, you just bought at the peak and things have cooled off. 

partly, you bought trendy/meme stocks like BB and AMC. don't chase trends. when everyone is buying X, you should be suspicious and looking for Y and Z. 

ditto your core position needs to be something covering a broad cross section of the US market. S&amp;P 500 index, Russell 1000 index, a total market index. this will be a lot safer. IMO people should't start with single stock until they have at least a few thousand in a broad market index. 

&gt;Watching YouTube sometimes

the majority of YouTubers are worthless on stocks and investing. absolute trash. IMO the only things worthwhile on YouTube are interviews with Buffet/Munger, Peter Lynch, Joel Tillinghast, Howard  Marks, Joel Greenblatt, etc. professional investors with decades of experience. 

go to your local library. read books on investing. I recommend the following: 

Benjamin Graham, The Intelligent Investor. Dated in parts, but the ""Mr Market"" chapter and ""margin of safety"" concepts are worth 10x their weight in gold.

Snowball: Warren Buffett and the Business of Life

Peter Lynch, One Up on Wall Street, and Beating the Street. In that order. Also a bit dated in some ways, but the basic advice and methods he teachers are bulletproof. 

Joel Greenblatt, The Little Book that Beats the Market

Christopher Browne, The Little Book of Value Investing.

Common Stocks and Uncommon Profits, by Phillip Fisher

His son Ken Fisher has written some good stuff, 100 Minds who Made the Market is a good historical overview of the history of Wall Street investing. The Little Book of Market Myths is free on his website: https://www.kenfisher.com/books/little-book-market-myths

gqp8b46;Viscoden;1;"The best early piece of information I gained was to think about buying a company in terms of using your own money to purchase the entire company.

It's easy to see a numbers on a screen and say ""it went up before, so I think it will again"".

It's hard to say ""no, I would not spend 600, 700 billion of my own money to purchase Tesla, because the company doesn't make enough money for me to justify that purchase"" when you see how well it has returned for shareholders in the last year. 

Investing is about risk management and facts. 

BB is currently valued at 6.29 billion, with an income of -830m (trailing twelve months). To put that in perspective, if you spent 6.3 billion dollars to buy all public shares of BB, you could then expect to lose an additional 830 million over the next 12 months. Now this is a flawed example because it is known that BB is turning around their business in a very attractive way, but it may take some time for that to catch up to make the business positive income. 

Now I do want to say that I do own a little bit of BB, but it's money that I can afford to let sit for a little while, and it's around half a percent of my active portfolio. I like the possibility of BB turning around the company and becoming a huge tech company once again.

I'd say that from my perspective it seems like you are at a point where you need to start laying the foundation for a solid portfolio. I'd recommend things like MSFT, AAPL, JPM, EBAY. I try to pay attention to P/E ratios and to buy when I think a company is at a good value. All of these companies make a TON of money, and I'd be impressed if any one of them failed within the next ten years. 

I'd caution you to reevaluate ""get rich quick"" buys, as they will statistically not work out well for you. Better to take 20% every year and turn that in to a compounding machine than to take 100% one month and lose it all over the next year. 

You won't turn your $500 back in to $2,000 in a few days, but you could retire in the future using this method. Try out the math for making a 20 or 30% annual return over 10 years. Start with something like 10k and watch what happens. And that's not even including what you could add to it over that time as well.

I'm not a financial advisor, always do your own research and come to your own conclusion. Remember that your money is on the line. I wrote this at 2 in the morning so please forgive any mistakes I may have made.";stocks;2021-03-12 15:50:37

gqo59a0;Frankocean2;1;"As a fellow Mexican investor on the gastronomic world we thank you for your services. 

And thank you so much for your input. I decided on BB precisely because slowly but surely has removed itself from the meme craze. My picked was largely decided on just how much pull BB has with the government. As a former government official either someone is making money out of that or BB is legit and thus will always have government back up. That should give the company a certain stability that other meme stocks don't have.

Overall agree with you on all fronts.";stocks;2021-03-12 08:08:55
gqo4jc6;BestGermanEver;1;"Hello, fellow investor. I can give you the immediate feedback that I invested into a lot of great Mexican products in my life.

Lots of stakes in Chili con Carne, Tacos, Fajitas, Burritos and the occasional Tequila. 

Paid off nicely, too, if you ask my gut.

Here are my personal opinions on your picks, you have to decide for yourself obviously if you take the leap and invest:

On BB and AMC, those are totally different worlds but rode on the same meme level a while ago.

Be careful especially about the prospects of AMC, it being a highly memed stock in the past few weeks which has bascially pumped its value up to meme levels. The current level looks to be elevated again in anticpation of ""financials"". Set your personal limit on what you feel is a good entry point and stick to the plan. Personally, I'm not sure on that one, but if I'd get it, it would have to be for a long term recovery in light of their reduced but still high debt levels and insecure future.

BB is probably the more solid future story. The current level seems to be the ""bottom line"" consensus of the wider market. It has come down from a pumped, meme level spike, so be mindful of where you want to enter. Long term for sure.

Oil has been written off for dead several times already... but it never died. It will transition ""one day"" (whenever that might be) but we still run on it. So it will be a rock solid part of your total portfolio for the foreseeable future.

No idea on Element 25. It's a bet on resources, which can go every which way near to mid-term. Anything to do with ""Batteries"" is of course a bet on future EV and Robotics, so your guess will be as good as anyone's. Long term if you believe in it.";stocks;2021-03-12 07:57:58

This earnings report at the end of the month goes well? 15-20? That probably optimistic. This earning report shows more of the same? I'd be surprised if it hit 15 by EOY. But again it all depends if BB can show they can turn all this amazing news into money. They have a LONG record of not doing so, so they are fighting history.";stocks;2021-03-12 07:46:40

gqnoctq;LumpyShoulder4339;2;BB needs actual positive news not more technical analysis or something-something security-EV. That‚Äôs not enough to lift this stock anymore. We need high profile partnerships and something that is actually positive and concrete.;stocks;2021-03-12 04:34:08
gqno8pj;Ka11adin;1;"There are some amazing DDs on BB here on reddit. I would highly suggest you check some of them out as they are far better than I am at researching and finding out about a company. 

Short list, BB is a cybersecurity company, one of the only ones who is certified to be used by the government in their own communication networks as well as in EVs. They have a unique type of real time operating system that allows security by essentially having a bunch of different systems running separately. It's hard to explain as I'm not well versed in the technology of it, but it seems to work and work well. 

BB QNX (their EV software) is in 61% of EVs currently and they are contracted with something like 70% of auto makers (yes most of the big ones) to use QNX. 

Also, on cybersecurity, we just had a ton of big profile hacks that caused who knows how much damage. BB was completely unaffected. Almost every one of their major competitors got hacked. They did not. It has been a major selling point for BB lately and hopes are that it shows up on the balance sheet at the end of the month. 

Now, bearish case, BB has been transforming from phones into cybersecurity over the past 7 years or so. You get a little identity crisis when that happens. That could go on for a bit longer, or it could finish up in the next few years we are all unsure. 

The CEO, Chen, has been CEO for the past 7 or 8 years and BB has consistently underperformed at earnings under his leadership. Mountains of good news comes out and.... nothing. They seem to have a hard time monetizing their leverage that they have built up. So the bearish case is ""they haven't made money under this same guy for years with similar good news, I'll wait till they can show they can earn a profit"". To make matters worse, BB is moving into a cluttered field of competition that is ripe with big names. Their major competitors in their field are Tesla, Google, and Apple, among others. Not names you want to get into a tussle with. 

Lastly, the big thing with me is the new CEO of Amazon as of this coming September believes in BB so much he partnered with them to create the future of Amazon. IVY is a software to use in the EVs for warehouses and deliveries for Amazon. This wont show up on balance sheets for 2 or 3 years according to Chen. 

Overall, seems like a solid play in my eyes. Bit gambly but they seem to have turned a corner recently and have signed up with some big names and their product shows significantly more strength than the competitions. 

Dont take my word for it though, I quite literally know NOTHING about stocks and am only trying to save so I can retire at 55. If BB rockets then ill be just as excited as everyone else. I will never put more in than I can afford to lose.";stocks;2021-03-12 04:32:54
gqnnsog;Nakamura9812;5;Probably getting some more discounted SOLO and BB. SOLO has earnings coming up on 3/24, but I like their low priced single seater. EVs are all still really expensive for most people, this one is like $20k and plugs into a regular 3 prong outlet so it fulfills a niche area of the market so I could see them doing decent volume. BB has earnings on 3/31, and well....I think everyone at this point has read some DD articles and think this stock is undervalued, it‚Äôs just been dicking around the $10 range since it fell victim to the trading halt when it had a lot of momentum. It will break back out in time, too strong of a company, I‚Äôm sure we are in store for some more good partnerships, because apparently the partnership with Amazon isn‚Äôt enough for people lol.;wallstreetbets;2021-03-12 04:28:17

BB

They have some amazing fundamentals, are in a great space, are trading low, have fantastic news coming out on a pretty regular basis, and have a massive moat in their industry. 

The reason they are undervalued is twofold. 1) large swaths of investors still see them as a phone company (changing rapidly so this will be gone in the not so distant future) and 2) they have not truly turned a profit in the last few years. Investors care about 1 thing. Making money. Blackberry has not proved they can do so yet. 

I FIRMLY believe they will be able to turn a profit. Their entire model and everything they are doing looks like foundation work for the next step. In my mind the next step is is with IVY. I have faith the company will be huge in the EV market. 

So I buy little bits and pieces of the company with every paycheck. I was happy about the correction the past few weeks as I sold out of some very poor decisions I made when I first started trading and bought more BB. Made up about 80% of my losses from the bad trades. 

There are a lot of people who dont believe in BB. And for very good reasons. their critiques of the company are valid. But I have faith so I see downturns as a chance to buy of something I believe in. I wouldnt call this a gamble play as I dont do options, I have only bought actual stocks. So the value may go down if they loss market share, but I will never truly zero out. 

From my new mind, that's what investing is all about. Find companies you actually believe in and then root for them to succeed with you dollars.";stocks;2021-03-12 00:08:09

""Of the 26,000 stocks, a mere 1,000 have accounted for all of the profits in stocks since 1926. And just 86 stocks ‚Äî one-third of 1% ‚Äî were responsible for half of those gains""



What this means is, over a very long period of time (let's say 20 years), most stocks will end up under performing the market, or outright lose you money.


Its often nearly impossible to predict the next amazon, and impossible to predict which Giant will be the next BB or Cisco.

I almost dread Mondays, I do not look forward to the uncertainty. I have made a good amount of money this year and do not want to lose it.

My investment approach is reasonably sensible in my opinion (e.g no exotic wild stocks such as GME/Cineworld/BB/Nokia).  I am NOT an emotional investor, I am willing to ride the waves and invest based on fundamentals.

I usually buy dips when I have spare cash. I bought shares when prices were low (leaving me a large buffer for when stocks dip in price).

I'm not an emotional investor, I will not act on my emotion when the market is seeing red but I definitely feel it when red days do come. (most of the time I will look for opportunities to buy during red days).

Then again, I love Mondays when the stock market sees green, that makes me happy.";stocks;2021-03-10 17:55:29

gqgd2e2;Ap3X_GunT3R;1;"Personally, I wouldn't bet on a cybersecurity ETF unless you plan on holding for the long term. They will be able to offer you quality averaged gains which is very nice and takes the legwork out from researching stocks. The issue is you're paying an expense ratio of .5%-.6% to beat VTI or VOO at .03%. Many of these cybersecurity companies are most likely holdings within VTI and VOO to an extent. 

As another comment notes, this sector is constantly being disrupted and competition is FIERCE. Companies can see their products swapped out for any number of reasons. Innovation is key and it's very hard to figure out who might bring the next game changing product. 

I recommend doing the research and taking a direct position in plays.

Other wallstreetbets Reddit stocks were mixed. AMC (AMC) followed suit trading up 7%, and Blackberry (BB) was up 2%, while Nokia(NOK) was up 2% and Palantir(PLTR) was inching toward 1% up early Wednesday.

Other wallstreetbets Reddit stocks were down Wednesday pre-bell, including Tesla (TSLA) that traded slightly lower and UWMC that was down 1%. Rocket Cos(RKT). (RKT) was also slightly down, and so were Advanced Micro Devices(AMD) and Apple(AAPL) .

gqfxwcl;FrgElder;1;"I really want the ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs the next short squeeze‚Äù fad to just die off already. Short interest was almost never mentioned in older DD posts unless it was exceptionally high and there was an obvious positive catalyst in the future that the shorts weren‚Äôt taking into account with their bear thesis. I remember seeing it only really related to TSLA before the whole GME ordeal. 

AMC/BB were never short plays, they were just people who FOMO‚Äôd after GME skyrocketed and wanted to look for the ‚Äúnext GME‚Äù without analyzing the underlying fundamentals of the situation.  Wild price fluctuations in both were simply due to retail investors frenzy. 

I‚Äôm long BB and while I find it interesting AMC was able to stave off bankruptcy due to retail investors, I don‚Äôt see squeezing or being a good long term investment.

gqfb5yo;JohnnyBoyJr;1;"Go with some things that will be around in 20, 30, 40 years and won't be bought out by another company for stock. Otherwise you'll be left with cash and/or partial shares in a company you don't really want.

GIS General Mills is something your kid will eat and identify with. Lucky Charms to Annie's mac &amp; cheese to granola bars for adults. Up 3.200% since 3/9/1981.

KO / PEP Coke and Pepsi. Coke is beverage-oriented and Pepsi is beverage and snacks.

KO is up 6,500% since 3/1981 and PEP is up 7,100% since 3/1981

And don't be afraid to go with stocks that make up the infrastructure of the world, and can dominate said world. V &amp; MA Visa &amp; Master Card. The world is going cashless and they have the most skin in the game. Will B-eye-t-c-o-y-n dominate? Well, nobody really knows who created it... It's possible it could crash &amp; burn. V &amp; MA are well-established worldwide. MA is up 8,000% since IPO'ing in 2006 and V is up a paltry 1,400% since 2008.

Oil will always be needed for something. Maybe not filling up gas tanks, but it usually makes up your carpet, finished wood, plastics, some clothing, packaging - virtually everything you use either has oil or oil was required in the manufacturing pricess. Just because the world is switching to EV's doesn't mean oil is going anywhere. Things still need to be lubricated. Oil is controlled by a world cartel. If they don't like how low the price of oil is, they simply collude to pump less, which boosts the price. XOM for the long run. Up 1,300% since 3/1981.

I would also recommend buying a bunch of shares of different companies/ETF's so your little one(s) can see how they performed over time, rather than just having 4 shares of MSFT. If you give them a stock that goes up 8,000% by the time they're 15, that could really teach them some lessons for the rest of their life -- even if it is only 1 share.  

And maybe spend a few bucks on meme stocks.  Show your kid(s) what happens when you jump on bandwagons.  BB for $10 or NOK for $4.  For what it could teach them, it could be the best $14 you ever lost.";stocks;2021-03-10 07:57:11

IMPORTANT! There is no ‚Äúofficial FINRA‚Äù short report

Huge misconception I‚Äôm seeing is that the information that you see on FINRA-markets.Morningstar.com is an ‚Äúofficial FINRA‚Äù short report. It‚Äôs not. It‚Äôs just FINRA‚Äôs link to Morningstar which doesn‚Äôt always have accurate data. The info is NOT official and does NOT come from FINRA. 
Why is this important? Morningstar has the wrong float on 2 stocks you may have heard of- AMC and GME. They have the GME float as 27M shares (??) it‚Äôs 54M. They have AMC float as 285M it‚Äôs 400M. 

Most websites have stale float for AMC because they issued a ton of shares in Jan and they‚Äôre not accounting for Silver Lake conversion. Morningstar doesn‚Äôt include any insider or company that owns more than 10% of share in the float calc which is just...wrong? Fido‚Äôs shares def should have been in float. For example look at MarketWatch. They have the float as 54M. A lot of confusion about ‚Äúwhat is the real short interest‚Äù doesn‚Äôt stem from ‚Äúwhat are the total shares short‚Äù it stems from ‚Äúwhat is the float?‚Äù

**TL; DR** FINRA does NOT have an official short interest report. NYSE and NASDAQ separately report SI. NASDAQ is available to public online. NYSE is available for a fee. Info on that page is from a 3rd party provider- Morningstar, which isn‚Äôt 100% accurate. Bloomberg gets the SI from the exchanges and people can already see it. You don‚Äôt have to wait haha. 

(Also- I don‚Äôt think it even matters! If enough people think the stock has high short interest it will trade that way. Last SI report saw GME short decline again and that day the stock started its second moon)

gqdl4sl;barelyrolling42069v2;1;You buy the option to purchase 100 shares of a stock at your strike price. That doesn't matter though, most retards here just buy it and then try to sell it back to someone else once the stock crawls up and the premium goes up with it.I would say that probably about 95% of the people on here have never even or don't even know how to exercise a call option. so if I were you, I would just go ahead and buy a call option. You basically spend a certain amount of money which would be considered this call options extrinsic value, and then you hope that the extrinsic value increases so then you could sell it. What you have to worry about is theta decay which is the extrinsic value of the call option reducing over time as well as intrinsic value which means the stocks overall price going down. But honestly, if I were you, I would choose a somewhat cheap stock like BB or AMC, and then buy a call or put option and then see where it goes.

gqd8bm7;TendieSupasta;3;I'm still deep into Blackberry, BB. There are rumors that Fairfax  holdings, which already has %8 of shares, is thinking of doing a  takeover. They invested years ago, were going to do an acquisition but  didn't and then Chen the current CEO got put into place. Fairfax is  choked because the stock hasn't performed for them, but they obviously  believe in the company, they've been holding for so long. This company  is ready to moon in the next year or two as an EV play which will hold  its high value. They've been slowly but surely building their company  up. Back in end of January BB started to take off but got decimated  after the spike. It's currently at around %37 down from it January high.  So basically we have a very large buyer who would love to get this  already undervalued stock. If they want my stock I'd like to sell it to  them at at least $100, lmao.

gqcswrt;jackswhatshesaid;2;"Oh absolutely this.  I wasn't speaking from a market standpoint, but from a personal need standpoint.  I have a cracked S8+; I'm definitely in the market of ""I really don't need to upgrade my phone every year.""  I did when the S6 came out and was suckered into all the neat gadgets like NFC, IR blaster, curved display, wireless charging, etc, but nothing's innovative at this point.  The new phones are much faster than mine, but I really don't need a faster chip for Reddit.  Considering the fact that the S21's feel like a nerf to the S20, innovation in phones are definitely moving sideways.  It seems like Samsung isn't even trying to hide it anymore, the new generation Galaxys is almost the same as previous gen, and you're still missing some hardware.  

And you're 100% right.  The consumer is fickle, I do believe there will always be an Apple fanbase, but I also think that gap is narrowing.  My gf's mom used to push Apple on us back in the 2014-2018 years, and just recently she sang a different tune that she only uses Apple because it's a company phone; she prefers the cameras on the Samsung.  Recency bias is a bitch. 

That's exactly why, as a consumer, I'm hoping somebody comes along and pushes the boundaries.  I think competition got stagnant, and rather than being able to one up each other, most competitors folded.  It wasn't lucrative and Samsung by far and large had the lions share of the market.  Phones that had great products (when working) such as HTC and BB went away and the rest followed.";wallstreetbets;2021-03-09 18:09:25

BlackBerry Limited (NYSE:BB) has teamed up with Desay SV Automotive to launch a dual-screen virtual smart cabin domain controller to enable safer driving.
Leveraging the QNX Hypervisor and the QNX Real-time Operating System (RTOS), the new technology is now available in leading Chinese automaker Chery's Tiggo 8 Plus and Jetour X90 models.
BlackBerry QNX has a broad portfolio of embedded software, including safety-certified versions of its operating system, hypervisor, development tools and middleware for critical systems in automotive and beyond.
Automakers and Tier 1's use BlackBerry QNX software in their advanced driver assistance, handsfree and infotainment systems, along with their digital instrument clusters and connectivity modules.
BlackBerry's pedigree in safety, security, and continued innovation has led to its QNX technology being embedded in more than 175M vehicles on the road today.
BB stock has been volatile over the past few weeks after being caught up in recent Reddit/WallStreetBets driven short-squeeze mania. The stock is down almost 29% over the past month after rising 112.8% in January according to data from S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence.
BlackBerry faces significant competition from Google's Android and the open-source Linux in the automobile OS space, says Value Kicker in a SA article, ""BlackBerry: A Contender In IoT Facing Stiff Competition""

If I was you, i would look at stocks that have a very steady value. ie, their beta is close to 1. That way, you're not just gambling. Cause right now, I'd say that you should put your money in ETFs and only invest in stocks with dividends because if you aren't researching the shit out of any companies, then you're pretty much gambling.   


For the most part, Cannabis companies may grow, but look at any company and their finances are garbage. I can't find one company that has good finances that is in the weed business.   


That's my advice because if you're a beginner, get out of anything that is BB/AMC/GME/PLTR/Weed/EV/NIO/TSLA. Don't buy anything at the ATH. Just don't. There's always pullback.";stocks;2021-03-09 13:34:46

gqbncut;SoggyEntertainment79;1;"4:30 am west coast time. Dow up .5%, s&amp;p500 up 1%, and Nasdaq up 2.2%. I have 8 different dashboards -  covering on average 8 to 12 stocks, most individual, some ETF's. All are up with a few averaging over 5% increase based upon pre-market activity. Will it hold up for the trading day? Doubtful. Be flexible is my mantra. When options trades go sideways better imo to take the loss and redeploy available capital. To hope against hope that a bad position will miraculously turn around is vain.  Accept the mistake and sell it before it expires worthless. 

Sometimes it is better to simply believe what the market tells us than to fight it or try to prove that it is wrong. If an increase in bond yield triggers a sell off in big tech why fight it? Rather try to understand why this is so. 

Do your homework. Do you know what stocks are in the various ARK funds? What about QQQ or DDM? Do you know the market capitalization of the various stocks you own? Do you know the difference between value, growth and speculative stocks? Did you know that the Nasdaq and the Djia are diverging by the largest amount since the late '90s?

If you follow a Reddior who always throws out a disclaimer: ""don't listen to anything I say. I dont know what I am talking about"" yadda yadda. Be aware - imo - that such folks are the worst sort of demagogues that exist?

gqb9egq;MauerAstronaut;1;"Lots of talk about meme stocks. With those you can win hard but also lose hard. In January, illegal shenanigans happened, many people missed the exit point and became bag holders. Some of those are green again now, others are not. GameStop is a unique situation, all those new squeeze plays are super dangerous.

Over the last few weeks, growth and tech stocks were getting butchered. The rebound should be as massive as the pullback, so those might give you a head start. Hot ones are, among others, PLTR, ROKU, SKLZ. Personally, I would probably buy growth now and set a limit of 50‚Äì100% gain to sell half and put it into safer investments. Or put all in ARK ETFs, because the are into growth but know better than you or me how to rotate.

Half-meme stocks that might be an idea: BB and PLTR (already mentioned but fits here).

Note that I have not been investing for very long and you generally should not trust anyone pumping any stock. I have a position in PLTR and BB and still thinking about the other ones.";stocks;2021-03-09 10:01:00

Weeks ago when GME first squeezed, I had BB shares. About 4,400 at a cost average of $17.69. I sold all those shares today for about a $35k loss with the intent to buy the dip on Apple, hopefully make some $$ back, then move back into BB shares with more capital to buy more shares. 

So here i am holding 69 (hehe) calls for AAPL June 18, $125 strike that I bought today, down $3,000. REALLY hoping for a bounce this week or next to take my money back to BB, as I‚Äôm long term bullish on it.

Throwing my two cents in here as a former wireless telecom rat and now a business user of all the systems that are being talked about in the above.

This. Shit. Is. Real.

A significant percentage of businesses that use an enterprise level accounting system, do so via... **Microsoft** (bolded for the retards in back) Dynamics and GP, formerly GreatPlains. This shit runs EVERYTHING. Inventory control, taxation, shipping data, customer data, banking information. EVERYTHING.

Now, baby daddy Blackberry (who not to long ago, i.e. pre-iphone, OWNED the enterprise space on MOBILE) is about to become **BIG** **DADDY** **BLACKBERRY.**

gq644aq;tientutoi;1;Oil barreling towards $80/bb - almost 70% increase since Biden took office. Gas prices across the U.S. üöÄüöÄnot too far behind. Biden‚Äôs decision to restrict US oil supply is largely to blame for spike as it gives global oil price control back to OPEC, who will inevitably try to regain lost profits from 2020. But mah no inflation and Biden good for the economy. Price of goods will follow shortly and then dum dum dum certain overvalued stock prices. ü•Åü•Åü•Å;wallstreetbets;2021-03-08 02:43:01
gq61vro;Fearless_Talk;1;Oh that‚Äôs right I just forgot BB was awarded 2021 Gold award for cyber security program of the year on top of partnerships and collaborations with Amazon‚Äôs AWS and BBS ONX..

gq5y7ml;BHOmber;1;"I have options enabled in my Fidelity Roth and they weren't letting me sell CCs on BB last week. Only reason I averaged down from 16 was to slang calls, but they obviously didn't want me to do that shit.

gq5xjtg;Adventurous-Walrus-7;1;My theory: every bodies pulling out of bb and going into gme so that we can support the squeeze, once tendies rain from heaven like mana to the Jews in the desert were all moving onto bb.

gq5wofu;yeoldecotton_swab;1;I sold when I saw the correlation then. In at around 12, sold at 22 because I knew this move was not organic at all. Bleh, poor $BB, no one seems to give a damn on good news. Or maybe they crater this stock to let it moon? Who knows.;stocks;2021-03-08 01:34:08
gq5w2c7;BillPaxtonsHair;1;"BB was a losing bet unless you were already in at the New Year and hopped off at the bubble. Aside from that one outlier, it‚Äôs a turd of a stock. 

Hold indefinitely on the off chance that there‚Äôs another social media fueled bubble (unlikely) or dump it in favor of a winner.
