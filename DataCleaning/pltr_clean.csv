Quit trying to hold the ceiling up with calls. Just buy long term puts and wait for a 20% correction. After that, sell puts until you get assigned at a fair valuation in a company that isn‚Äôt SNOW, ROBLOX, CRSR, GOEV, RIOT, or any other shit meme stock.

2021-03-17 16:00:42,"&gt;The caveat is that Palantir's software deployment requires Forward Deployed Engineers (known as FDEs) to work with clients to integrate the software into the client's systems.  Critics of Palantir believe that this reliance on people, means that the product is not easily scalable and that the CEO's growth estimate is too optimistic.  


After spending a few years at a corporation, this argument puzzles me a bit (not arguing against you, just further adding). Every major 3rd party system requires we either pay a consult agency to set up or we hire a bunch of new people to set up and support the product. I'm talking about software like servicenow, PeopleSoft, SAP, salesforce, etc... All these require human capital, no different then what PLTR does. So personally, I fail to see how this is a negative other than scaling. But that's a simple solution, you hire more people."

2021-03-17 15:46:49,"Ok then... let's look at some other signals... 

At the end of Feb., 3 PLTR executives sold 2.7 million shares. Ask yourself... why would they do that? Yes, the are probably mostly paid in stock, but which situation is more likely? All 3 executives needed the money right then and there OR All 3 executives believed that's the highest price they would be able to get for a very long time? 

Also... a quote directly from Karp in this interview: ""We‚Äôre in this for the long haul. If you are speculating or you‚Äôre thinking about this short-term, there are plenty of other things to invest in. If you want something else, it‚Äôs a huge world. Buy some other stock. You don‚Äôt have to buy Palantir. No one is forcing you.‚Äù

The CEO is practically saying ""Don't expect the stock price go anywhere anytime soon."" What does he mean by long haul? 5 years? 10 years? 20 years? Who the hell knows. Either way, it's a signal to me that the company leadership does not expect their stock to perform at or above market levels anytime soon."
2021-03-17 15:44:46,"Agree here. Anyway I don't expect analysts or brokers to understand how things technically work or can be technically defined. I saw AI &amp; PLTR comparisons, even AI &amp; Google comparisons.

They have provided data on contract amounts and lengths even in their recent quarterly earnings call. So, I am unsure where you are getting that non-info from. Do they show each and every contract individually? Obviously not because thats sensitive information. In terms of future development and their current focus its on modularity so it makes it easier to integrate their software into other ERP and gives possibility for use of smaller/medium companies."

Check optionsprofitcalculator.com to see if at that price target on that date your proftis would be greater than what they are now. Then re-evaluate what you really believe the stock‚Äôs price movement is going to be like and weight the risk/benefit of keeping it.

If the stock shot up quickly and you think it could either trade sideways or go down before exp, then it might be a good idea just to sell the option now because theta will chip away at the option‚Äôs value as time goes on.

I have a 20$ call option on PLTR expiring next June. I plan on holding it until then because if PLTR were 20$ right now, I‚Äôd buy 100 shares at that price in a heartbeat. 

On the other hand, when PLTR was 22$ I had bough an April 28$ call. When PLTR shot up to 26 over a few days I sold it because not only would I rather buy shares at 25$ (which I expected it would get back down to), but also because steep price movements either way have a greater impact faster on price movement and I didn‚Äôt expect with enough faith that it would continue to rise at that rate and to that price point.

2021-03-17 14:55:27,"I've done the research.

Their biggest customer is the government. Our government is up to it's eyeballs in debt and constantly under pressure to reduce costs. Their business opportunities in the private sector are almost purely speculative at this point with no hard data on contract amounts, length of contract, services to be provided, etc.

Also, their platform development plan (what they do with their software in the future... what they are working on) is practically non-existent. 99% of the time, in the software world, this means that they have no real plan. If you have a great plan on where your software is going, you talk about it. You brag about it. You give your customers confidence that the things they want the software to do are being worked on or are at least planned for. PLTR does not have this. Those are the reasons I'm not in it.

Their business opportunities in the private sector are almost purely speculative at this point with no hard data on contract amounts, length of contract, services to be provided, etc. 

Also, their platform development plan (what they do with their software in the future... what they are working on) is practically non-existent. 99% of the time, in the software world, this means that they have no real plan. If you have a great plan on where you software is going, you talk about it. You brag about it.

-We retest 20-22 and double bottom

-We go sub 20.

2021-03-17 12:15:20,"If you don‚Äôt need the money then don‚Äôt panic sell anything. The first rule about the stock market is to not panic or be reactive. And stop fucking with options until you really understand the market. Fascinating that you say you have no clue where the market will go short term, but yet options are entirely dependent on that knowledge and you bought them anyway. You gotta be a little more disciplined than this. 

Personally I go out of my way to avoid over-expensive companies with so much downside like PLTR and most green energy, in order to avoid this very scenario. so I can‚Äôt really give advice on your choices. But if you insist on sticking with these picks the first thing I would do in approx 4 weeks is buy more of the long term options over the next few months to stop those from drowning. In 5 years your stocks will probably recover but your options will not exist. So those losses are more urgent

This is assuming you still believe in these two companies. I am not telling you that you should or should not.

Either way, the macro-economic environment is going to be harsh for these two companies for a while. You can probably expect more losses."
2021-03-17 12:14:45,"Rising rates are bad for companies with high P/E. Due to the discount cash flow model companies with cash flows further out in time have their valuations hurt with rising rates. PLTR is a young high growth company, they don‚Äôt make much money now. But the thought is they‚Äôll make much more longer out in time. As rates rise the value of that future cash is worth less today. Hence the broad downturn in Tech as rates rise."

Amazon, Google, Microsoft, Facebook are on the knife's edge right now (as in, the last and next couple of years). People are worried about their personal data, there is tons of scandals with how they use it to influence people, and these giants being too big and too powerful are something that (at least publically), both left and right seem to agree. I think everyone knows that they will not be allowed to operate as they do now forever, so I'd guess 'the government would try to avoid being dependent on them as well. 

(For the record, I'm not naive, I am pretty sure that the government will not ""save the people"" from this. They probably have most politicians in their pocket on both ends of the spectrum, to some degree, and politicians love what tech can do for them, so I doubt they will put a *real* stop to it. But at least publically, there is scrutiny, and likely, there will be changes on how they can/will operate)."

Finally Kathy Wood‚Äôs Ark has purchased several million shares and her target is a min 15% year or year, basically doubling. She is interested in companies that disrupt. However, there are a lot of bears and swing traders on the stock. It hit 45 a few months ago and has returned to the mid 20 range been pretty flat since then.  Also I‚Äôm totally bias on the stock, I know of the govt use and the capabilities which are very impressive and finally I‚Äôm pretty heavily invested as this is my largest holding.

Bond yields are rising because of a growing economy and market. Low rates will continue to prevail."" Maybe he'll throw a bone to investors with something like ""while we do not see cause for concern over near-term inflation, we will monitor it closely and have the tools to address it if the need arises"". Of course, the tool would be an early rate hike, which would cause the markets to puke just as much as concerns over inflation.

Idk man, I'm an optimist but if tomorrow is flat, I think that's a win. I expect some panic selling, that's for sure.

The flip side is that a growing real economy is good for the market in the aggregate (if hyper speculative tech pulls back, maybe don't have 80% of your portfolio in PLTR, ARKK, and meme junk bought at ATHs). VIX is falling as well. It's like the market wants to continue this bull run, but isn't ready to actually do it. There's a disturbance in the force.

Yield raises = market throws a tantrum Real/perceived inflation = market throws a tantrum Perceived early rate hike = market throws a tantrum

Would be lying if I said I wasn't a bit nervous about where we go from here. Maybe the stimulus provides a very short term liquidity pump, but I think it's already priced in for the most part."

The company does not provide great earnings, they over emphasize on their growth percentage when it was almost all government contract and barely any commercial.  My issue with the stock is that the valuation of a company that provides such mediocre results at 40b means they have to execute perfectly just to avoid a drop in price. I don't want to pay such a premium for the hype. They could have a great product, but execution of sales and revenue is what makes the return on investment. You hear all the shareholders pitch how they're not a new company just because they're new to the market.  This leads me to a larger concern to why I should expect them to get it together in the next 10 years when they haven't in the previous 20.

All that doesn't really matter on here though because the pltr  bulls love to cover their ears to any bear case. They downvote anyone with an opposing view,  so all you'll see is the great hype posts.  This will cost retail investors money as they're drawn in and will buy at any price because there's no skepticism on the current valuation. I would buy pltr, but not anywhere over 25b figuring in the current partnerships (and thats still a risky price based on revenue.) No one can seem to give a projection to how much revenue each blue chip deal is in dollars and cents for annual earnings at the end if the day, they just hear the names and scream buy. Math out a generous stream of income just from those deals and you still wont be talking 2x their current revenue which even at a generous multiplier puts 40b high."

2021-03-17 04:44:28,"I'm going to post this here for visibility.  I've tried everything to get this approved.  No hate on the mods.  Thoughts?

Karp's interview is being overblown.  The headlines are clickbait.  He talks America needing software(pure software/AI) that is the best to AVOID conflict in order to stay ahead of America's adversaries. Basically he's claiming Palantir Technologies to be S class disruptive Tech that can lead future innovations for America.

Karp would rather put his focus on having the company put its ""best foot forward"" for the sake of protecting America and its private and public interests.

He was asked in the middle of the interview ""How would he entice new commercial customers?""

He then starts talking about the how Foundry and Gotham are unique technically speaking ( claims his tech is 5 years ahead of everyone else low key), and the way they do business is unique.  For example he explains that Palantir  in the commercial space, Foundry is a Finished product as opposed to other ERP systems that require you to do an entire IT installation that can take months.  Foundry can be installed as a whole stack in a few days!  That difference is how Karp and Palantir thinks Software companies will sell their products.  He mentions that typically ERP systems entice customers with Jargon that promises to deliver instead of providing a product that stands out from the rest.  He truly believes Palantir is in a class of its own.   He actually believes despite having Elite tech that he provides for the biggest companies in the word, he thinks that Palantir can provide a ton of value to smaller to medium companies by offering superior ERP Software transforming their business to save them millions of dollars.

They talk little bit about PLTRs partnerships including 3M, BP, IBM, and AWS.  They talk about how IBM and AWS were thought to be rival companies to Palantir but instead decided to join forces because those companies understand how difficult it is to build what Palantir built with Foundry and Gotham.

HE LIKES THE RETAIL INVESTORS, he HATES the ""INVESTORS"" who buy and sell the stock who don't have any clue about the company or its Tech.

He can't on camera ""PUMP"" the stock, so he just talks about how he's more focused on building the Company for the long-term.

TLDR

So about a fucking hour talking about how superior the tech( Foundry/Gotham) is compared to any other software company's tech and how Karps ideological view of supporting America and its western values by providing Superiority and Complexity in order to stay ahead of its adversaries.

Foundry is 5 years ahead of any other ERP software in the market.  IBM and AWS bow down to PLTR.

What you can do though is buy a call. This gives you the ability to exercise on someone else. Say you buy a PLTR 30c 3/19 for $0.05 - a contract that costs you 0.05x100 = $5 &lt;---Very cheap. - you buy this because you think pltr will go up higher than $30 per share before friday.

So tomorrow JDog gives his speech and talks about how the fed is going to use PLTR software and that it's the tits. This sends PLTR up to $33 a share 2 days before your contract expires. Now you see that the market is willing to pay $300 for your contract because you could just exercise for $30 a share and immediately sell the shares for $33. But you're poor and can't afford to exercise, so you just sell the contract to someone else for $300 and make yourself a profit of $295 after subtracting the $5 you originally paid.

These contracts don‚Äôt warrant that high of a valuation. With the new shares that hit the market don‚Äôt expect giant run ups like previously. It‚Äôs going to be a gradual climb from here in my opinion.

The only things that I'll add in terms of speculation is valuation and fundamentals have been tossed aside by growth prospectus and I see PLTR behaving much in that way as adoption grows. The other thing being I'm not entirely sure PLTRs markey share has been correctly identified. Right now its bulk is in defense contracts  which is the core of its software, but there are a lot private sector companies just testing the waters with what their analytics can deliver which tells me this can throw a positive wild card in expansion.

The $100 dollar target is more of a stretch goal and I'll be looking at how it has performed towards its first breakthrough of 50.00 in the first year to ramp up. If it's on track, I will more than likely expand my position to by 400 more shares."

So mr chairman, what do? If stock going to 100k then $800 a share is a frickin bargain. If squeeze squoze then it‚Äôs time to short. If gme has long potential what should its avg price be? If it‚Äôs just a volatility play, buy some near expiry options.

And not just gme. Get on nok, bb,amc,nvax,RKT,uwmc,thcb,qfin,aso,sos,pltr,tsla,goev,ride etc. bound to make lots of easy money by ‚Äòcoordinating‚Äô with us."

This company is a very long term play.  

It is basically the Magikarp fish Pok√©mon: the worst Pok√©mon and painfully difficult to level up, but eventually evolves into the powerful Gyarados after tremendous work.  A lot of people I know bash Palantir for still losing money after nearly 2 decades, but the software platform has come a long way.

They don't sell coal, they allow you to use your coal in a more efficient way you couldn't do without their engine."

Y'all say SI is maybe up to 900% and they say it's down to 27%. Hell, they even testified to congress that they covered.

We've seen some big gains but that seems to be mostly due to whales and other HF and today the price dropped way down to 179. Their goals are clearly not ours. Its just too much risk for me when I've already lost 20k on bb and pltr and nok.

If I get knocked down to zero it's going my to be too hard to climb back up. 20k is probably nothing to many of you

2021-03-16 16:51:28,"Literally like half of these comments under here are about gambling on SPCE, PLTR, etc. Which is what I assume somewhat what you already did if you lost 30% of your stimulus already.

I would focus on saving an emergency fund before investing anything. Its better to be safe with that first 10k or so in case you do ever need it for something important and unpredictable. Then you don't have to sell any of your holdings to pay for that event.

Then throw your extra money after that into SPY, VTI or another index fund and just add to it consistantly. With what seems like a huge workload its very unlikely you'll be able to effectively monitor the market to more actively trade. 

If you try to Meme-Stock your way to a 400% gain, it's much more likely you'll lose 50% instead, and then you're in an even worse position. Especially if you can't monitor it 24/7 to avoid any large drops. Investing is taking advantage of compound gains over multiple years, trading is taking advantage of short term fluctuations."

Alteryx also provides products for software analytics and data science.  They appear to have had $495m in revenues in 2020.  The share price has been ""hammered"" by the tech sell down but still hovers around $90.  And that's approximately $50 discounted off the 1 year target price of $145.

By comparison, PLTR is stuck at $26.50ish with a target of $26 (target info from Yahoo!Finance).  PLTR had over $1b in revenues in 2020.  They have government and commercial sides to their business.  They signed new contracts recently.  

Hello??? How in the world does a company with more than 2x the revenues of a competitor trade for a quarter of the price?  Quick searches suggest this is a similar story looking at other big data firms.

In my humble opinion, PLTR is on a big sale right now.  Long shares and calls."

I got my first job and I intend to invest my salary right away. This is my plan for investment every month:

-	30% on $INRG (iShares Global Clean Energy)
-	30% on $IITU (iShares S&amp;P 500 Information Technology)
-	30% on $VUSA (Vanguard S&amp;P 500 ETF)
-	10% on risky, single stock investments like $NET and $PLTR

The goal is to one day be able to use the earnings to purchase a nice house and land. Until that day comes, I only plan to purchase positions, with no liquidation whatsoever, especially since selling would mean paying taxes.

But valuations of desirable companies can stay stretched for a very long time, while valuations of undesirable companies can stay depressed for a very long time. 

Also, it's questionable how stretched valuations actually are with rates this low and monetary stimulus of this amount. Which is one reason why I think they continue to run for a bit longer. 

After that, and you start to see the effects of efficiencies created from increased technological adoption from the crash course all the ancient companies just received, mrna applications and gene editing to cure and treat disease, legitimate AI applications that allow next level ability of planning and predictability (like what PLTR is doing), autonomous driving, etc (I've heard things like no-code software, synthetic biology and ambient computing thrown around but don't know much about them). Right now we're getting to see the impact of all the future technological promise from previous decades (but maybe this is a sell the news moment for some?). 

Basically, I'll stay diversified because I can't predict the future, but to me, nothing screams buy international except for valuations and I've bought too many value traps in the past to use only one metric for investing."

2021-03-15 14:09:04,"I‚Äôve done a decent amount of research I hope to give some insight - I‚Äôll paraphrase how it was explained to me.

If you give a kid an instrument (say, a recorder flute) they‚Äôve never played before, they may be able to, after some time play hot cross buns, or three blind mice. But maybe their progress isn‚Äôt fast enough, or they get impatient and don‚Äôt see the point of continuing to practice with no discernible improvement, after a while.

If you give a kid that same recorder, but also music lessons with a good tutor for a year, they‚Äôll become better at using that instrument than they otherwise would have. They‚Äôll keep getting better until they reach their potential under the guidance of the tutor. After a year or so, the tutor leaves, but the kid still knows how to play the instrument fairly well. And the kid knows he can call the tutor to help him learn a new instrument if he desires to (like if a company used PLTR to better their logistics, and then decided to use it to monitor theft in their loss prevention dept).

So with the temporary cost of the engineer (this cost goes away once the client is set up = about a year), the client sees a good ROI. Happy clients renew/increase contracts and refer other clients. 

Opposite that, is that if there was no FDE, the client may not get the functionality of Foundry; like using the handle end of a spoon to eat soup. It‚Äôs the right tool used incorrectly. Clients wouldn‚Äôt see the value in signing with them, and a meh reputation would kill any chance of commercial success. 

So while the first year of a contract may not be profitable due to the FDE combined with the lower introductory rate, imagine the mess and expenses of ‚Äúgoing back to the old way‚Äù for the client."

2021-03-14 17:25:33,"Invest in safe, blue chip stocks. Don‚Äôt go gambling your parents retirement on meme stocks like GME and PLTR. 

Timing the market is impossible, and you‚Äôll almost always lose money if you try. If you‚Äôre nervous about an ‚Äúimpending crash‚Äù (based on what, I don‚Äôt know) then invest slowly. Every week, buy 5k in stocks till it‚Äôs all reinvested.

Some recommendations of safe stocks with good dividends:

AAPL (discounted heavily at the moment)
DIS
Honeywell
WMT (also discounted)
WM
VOO
VTI
RSP
SBUX
MSFT
JNJ
V
VYM
AXP
UNP
MA
AMZN
NERD
Costco
McDonalds

With these I‚Äôve been able to get min returns of 10-15 percent every year. It‚Äôs a diversified portfolio with many sectors so if one collapses you aren‚Äôt totally fucked. Don‚Äôt have more than 10% in any of these and you‚Äôll be fine long term.

Final price of advice is the same as the first. Do not gamble on meme stocks. It‚Äôs tempting, but like a siren song, you will most likely find yourself shipwrecked amongst the rocks."

Then say you want to sell a covered call option that expires this coming January. If you think the stock will double in that time period you might choose to sell the $50 options. Those will get you a premium of $4.40 per share. If the stock remains below $54.40 on the option expiration date you keep the premium and you still own the stock. If it finishes above that you keep the premium, and you get the profits between $27 and $54.40 per share.

Need a TL;DR? No, you can‚Äôt sell covered calls to pay for your stock bought on margin"

2021-03-13 23:19:00,"No I don't find that very odd tbh. Most subreddits with more than 5mil people have a dense bot structure to keep spam out and will inadvertently catch posts in favor of being hard on spam and overly cautious since hundreds of people are posting every minute trying to get posts on the sub. If they're organizing pump and dumps, tell me what they're pumping? Can you show proof of specifics accounts that are being ""allowed"" to post or that DD for various tickers that are currently on their ""hot DD"" list are P&amp;Ds?

Here are the top ""DD"" posts from the past 24 hours on WSB: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/search/?q=flair%3ADD&amp;sort=top&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;t=day

Here we see GME (obviously given its topical relevance), QFIN, HRB, DKNG, PYR, SKLZ, DASH, PLTR, XL, CLF, STAR, and the list goes on the further you scroll. If there is a pump and dump being organized by the mods, surely you can't pin that on GME which became a worldwide #1 topic and is obviously going to be the most talked about ticker not only on WSB but also on most every other stock related subreddit / website.

Sounds like you just think it's a conspiracy that you had a post removed on a huge subreddit, but go try to get a post going on any other subreddit with over 5 million subs and you'll most likely succumb to a similar fate of either having your post removed for non-transparent reasons or instantly buried."

He does lose money as if PLTR were to hit $100 for example he would miss out on actually owning PLTR and the potential premium as he sold the Calls when PLTR was at $25.

Which is why most people only sell CC at a relative peak in a stock price then ride the dip and close the contract.

2021-03-13 22:26:45,"PLTR 30 this week?"
2021-03-13 22:25:50,"I'm on my phone so I'll go through each one, two at a time if that's ok.

1) If it's an old company it turns a profit or at least has for a sustained period.
2) It could have been getting shorted from that time, but if I'm not mistaken it was comfortably above $10 for a decent while and then the price started to drop, nothing else massvely changed to warrant that imo. 
3) It certainly shouldn't drop the price.
4) It could have been shorted since then, and because it's profitable it didn't go under...tbf it's a mystery to me because nothing major happened that year to warrant the drop. Tin hat for me there I guess.
5) It gets enough shine to do well recently which is nice and I earned a little profit already which I'm too stupid to cash in on.
6) Cinema + Girlfriend was the crux of my point there. Historically good things happen there.
7) We're now 1-1 for tin hat theories! But seriously, the entry rate is low and affordable for those who don't have the initial funds to drop into GME and Two meme stonks isn't too much imo.
First I seen of GME it was a sign that made the front page of Reddit saying GME/AMC GO BRRR. And it caught my attention..Do if it was a diversion it worked to opposite for me because I now have shares in both.
8) We're good.
9) I personally consider cinemas to be a relavtively safe bet but personall preference there.
10) I agree, You could be right about PLTR, I like RKT myself too because they are a genuinely successful company also.
So shares in AMC, PLTR, RKT, and GME is not a bad ""bet"" imo and I don't think any is a distraction from the other because everyone knows them at this point.

Hope that halps."
2021-03-13 22:05:37,"I‚Äôll probably just add to my portfolio. ARKs, PLTR, BABA"
2021-03-13 22:00:09,"1. You are half correct, it sure is old but profitable is a strecth - yes they did have 2017 recently but other than that i'd say noees. 
2. No it has not, at the very least not on paper, 5 weeks total of 1 year has it been a ""10$ stock"" AMC has also been falling and failing since 2016. 
3. That might be true but what you need to take into consideration is the immensley huge volume AMC has - that short interest can be covered in a single day without even raising the avg. volume. 
4. It is a reasonable assumtion to assume AMC fell due to covid and I agree when we see Hollywood release all their movies as Covid is gone we should see a bump  in AMC. But I woul also like to point out AMC has been on a downward trajectory since 2016 - was covid a kick in the face: sure as fuck but AMC was still laying on the ground already. 
5. Can't answer this I have no idea and I guess it depends on whom you ask. 
6. It probably was and who could blame you? not like you had a flat TV in your room connected to the entire world when you were younger. hmms... we do have.... that right now yes? 
7. It sure is, I ask my self daily why... All I think is it was pushed by bots to drive money away from GME. I have zero proof of this but I fully believe it. 
8. I like it, no answer other than that. 
9. I think it could pay well when and if they and hollywood open fully, I've been contemplating holding over a few Q-reports but no longer than 2021, srsly no innovation left but they could make a nice chunk of profit this year with the above two conditions being met that is. 
10. That I for sure believe aswell but I think it'll be PLTR that will see the majority of all that newfound wealth."

2021-03-13 21:26:00,"Been selling CC since PLTR was $14. Built a big part of my position by doing that. The last 5,000 shares I got when AMC went from $2 to $20 in two weeks."

2021-03-13 21:09:06,"That‚Äôs what I was doing from when it was $15 to today. Looking for a more passive approach, RH taking too much of my time at the moment. I also hold PLTR in my ROTH IRAs for long term 10+ years hold. This was more of a yolo to buy a truck now and pay off my house if called."

2021-03-13 20:52:40,"My worst two plays were going balls deep in PLTR 28c 3/5 when it first dipped to 27 (I thought I was a genius, turns out I was an idiot), and then I bought a bunch of rocket shares at 29 and held on too long so I sold at like 35 instead of 41. 

Best play for me has been WFC this year. Bought a bunch of 37c 3/19, sold em at the top on Wednesday, then bought back in on Thursday went the price dipped below 39. So"
2021-03-13 20:47:06,"You must not understand how selling calls work, selling calls is bearish as you are hoping a dip occurs so you can buy to close your contract at a profit. 

Or you know that the stock won‚Äôt hit $65 and instead will dip so you can relax with theta decay.

If PLTR hits $65 he is now at risk of someone exercising the contract and having his shares called away, meaning he would miss on much more profit as PLTR rises in profit because he gave his shares away.

Think before you comment."

If PLTR has so much growth potential, why do the insiders never buy the stock?

No insiders have purchased PLTR going back to 10-2-2020?

For me, I can't visit my parents in the rural South without seeing dozens of ""sweepstakes"" buildings. Essentially just designed to rob the unknowing under the guise of ""entertainment"". 

I've never seen these people actually enjoy anything about the lottery tickets they buy daily. The entertainment is in that brief moment of dreaming what they'd do with all that money. But that's gone as fast as the next cigarette. 

I don't hate them, I grew up with them. But thankfully I made it out, and now I hate to see businesses like this prey on them."

2021-03-13 03:57:08,"I'm in this for long term. I do understand your point that this is being memed to death and likely being held primarily by short term redditors at the moment, however I feel that this is mostly due to PLTR being a dpo instead of an ipo. PLTR was downgraded and suppressed, likely as punishment for not doing an ipo. If this had ipoed instead, institutions would have loaded the boat and this would be a $50 stock, but we would not have had a chance to get in at $10.

There will definitely be much volatility with the stock, however the volatility will be trending upwards. We also have Cathie and ARK as confirmation that this is a good entry if you plan to hold long term.

The reason I want some KO is for the stability that was lacking in my portfolio. You are right though, the dividend on KO won't make you rich overnight, or even in a few years. However, KO has made countless millionaires by using the dividend reinvestment ""snowball"" effect.

I see at that everyone investing buys thinking that the company is going to make a lot more money. The question is, are they going to make enough money in the future to validate their value? How much money do they need to make to increase the value?  Where will they be in 10 years? If roblox takes 10 years to do 6 billion in a year,  are they still going to be worth 40 billion like EA? I don't know based on their guidance that they will be there any time in the next 5 years.  Is this going to tie up my money at this crazy premium? The clientele are children.  If we compare to platforms,  Twitter has a ton of users,  but hasn't traditionally been able to monetize well.....I guess where I'm going with all of this,  I love doing comparison shopping.  If something is going to tie up my money and the upside within the next decade is already priced in,  I can likely find something trading cheaper.  I think I would only get a sizeable return here on hype trading."

This is very much a bull market and a lot of it is driven by new participants but also disruptive companies like a TSLA or PLTR or DKNG that have young investors genuinely excited. Even GameStop‚ÄîI came for the squeeze‚Äîbut I‚Äôve stayed because I‚Äôm a gamer and I know there‚Äôs a vacuum between the massive ecosystem of gamers and streamers and the mainstream that needs to be filled and I know RC sits on their board and I saw what he did with Chewy. Sure, could be too little too late, but why not take a flyer on it? If nothing else, the fundamental forces at play for GME have inspired me to begin looking at another company rumored to be aggressively going digital now, and I can think of other real-time case studies that my friends and I are all considering when deciding to buy shares in a company. 

The beauty of this market is that information is plentiful and there are still plenty of safe companies out there with strong dividends that can be used to backstop a portfolio so we can feel comfortable betting on the riskier plays. There are plenty of value traps, sure, but also plenty of no brainers to balance it out.

It's investing heavily into growth which means LONG TERM GAINS. People still think it's a meme stock and it's going to suddenly moon based on good news alone.  I'm bullish, but I don't see meaningful returns until maybe 2025. If you don't like choppy, don't invest in a company that is in the bottom 5% profit margin in its industry. I know its a joke but people out there see this take it seriously and think that GME shedding $90 in a day or TSLAs 1000+ p/e is normal for the market.

2021-03-12 07:20:04,"I'm extremely novice so it's interesting reading all of the comments.

&gt;I want to own Palantir (PLTR) at $23.5, it is currently trading at $26. My assumption is that I can sell the put option (sell to open) contract for a strike price of $23.5 for whatever date I choose (looking short term just to start off - say April 1). If the price of PLTR drops to $23.5 at any point during that period and gets executed, I am assigned the shares at the strike price of $23.5 (minus the premium I receive so actually less than $23.5 overall). If it never hits the strike price of $23.5, the contract expires I get no shares but I collect the premium.

What is the difference between this and setting up a market limit for $23.5?"

2021-03-12 06:23:03,"Kinda. The requirement for your desire of owning PLTR at 23.5 is that the stock sinks to that level or lower on expiration, so that you would be assigned and the buyer of your contract could exercise their ride to put the stock to you for 23.5. If neither condition is fulfilled (both the stock at or under 23.5 and the time an expiration date), then all you would have is a short put contract and the premium you got for it.
The gotcha selling CSPs is if the stock plummets: you would find yourself short a deeply ITM contract and you would buy the stock at a price much higher than market. You could lessen your losses wheeling your way out of the hole (see r/thetagang) but it may take months if at all possible (see NKLA)."

2021-03-12 05:57:46,"PLTR vs SNOW.  

PLTR: Both my brokerage and CFRA stock report show only the last two quarters of financial data for PLTR.  Both also show yearly data for 2018-2020, which shows CARGR (compound annual revenue growth rate) of \~35%.   Even 35% is great!  But the lack of quarterly data is a unusual.  Where is the audited quarterly data?   

Despite the question marks about it's past, analysts are enthusiastic about it's future, forecasting 76% annual revenue growth over two years, which is absolutely astounding.

SNOW: all sources show a full set of 12 quarters of data for SNOW.  I presume these are audited financial results.  Squishy maybe, but not too soft.  Unlike PLTR's apparently unaudited 35% over last two years, SNOW's presumably audited growth rate is a whopping 138% over two years.  

Analysts are also enthusiastic about SNOW's future, forecasting 74% annual revenue growth over two years, which is absolutely astounding.

So the purported future is the same for both companies (76% vs 74% revenue growth), yet PLTR is trading at 40x TTM Rev and SNOW is trading at 108x TTM Rev.  Here's why:

ONE: PLTR slipped in sneaky guidance below estimates at last earnings announcement. 

TWO: it was supposed that PLTR would break out of the government sector and into the private sector after going public, but there's scant evidence of that in the most recent earnings report.  That calls some doubt on  the 76% growth forecast.  

THREE: PLTR's historic revenue growth is much lower than SNOW.  The forecast of 76% isn't reflected in it's historical data, so it's less believable.  

FOUR: PLTR's historic financial data isn't...all there...or something, so no doubt that's throwing cold water on the value."

Don't trade anything but stocks until you can consistently make money.  At that point learn options and start slow with maybe 10% of your capital.

You may not ever get exercised if it remains above that. Not to mention if it does fall that low you would have made more selling the put at that point in time instead of now and you'll lose out on any rebounds.

You must find a strike price where the premium minus the strike equals the price you want to enter at. Generally this will be ATM or even a little higher.

For example let's say PLTR is trading at $26 and an atm strike is $2.50. Come expiration PLTR is $25.50 and you get assigned. You then must purchase $2600 worth of shares but you keep the $2.50x100 premium which brings your *effective* cost basis of your new long position... $23.50."

Now $pltr goes up to $28 per share and the option premium might* now be $3.75. So now your 5 contracts are now worth a total of $1875. You can sell the 5 contracts for a profit of $575. 

This is the ""simple"" explanation. There's a whole lot of math and other variables that go into the pricing of the options. I'm just starting learn the math portion."

Standard disclaimer, not financial advice, your money, your responsibility.

I've been in the big corporate data space for the last 11 years advising companies to adopt the architecture PLTR has delivered.  Theses folks are so far ahead of other vendors.  They correctly assert their competition is in house teams.  I can tell you from experience, most big company tech developers are fairly mediocre and risk averse.  

There are stories that PLTR software was used to find Bin Laden.  I don't know if that is true but it is likely.  I am pretty sure that the basic research for this came from the 911 retrospective.  Various agencies had parts of the picture before the attack but we not able to ""connect the dots"".  This lead to massive funding for graph databases with formal semantics and inferencing.  

If you watched the demo, they explained that the core of the system is a formal, well managed, evolving ontology.  The data is mapped to this standardized definition of meaning and relationships.  That makes it much easier to combine data from many different sources and then apply the analytic layer with ML and visualizations.

The key result is this platform empowers organizations to execute is hours or a few days.  That was clearly the kind of requirement the DOD and other TLA agencies demanded.  So the value proposition is speed and flexibility.  Could a company build similar solutions in house? Maybe but it might take years.

The final thing that sealed my decision, PLTR has a track record of executing on the business and services side.

tldr; I like the fundamentals of this stock."

Net Loss looks bad, at (1,166,391), but much of their Cost of Revenue and Operating Expenses are stated to be stock-based compensation (SBC) expense, which totals 1,270,702, which is 56.07% of their 2,266,352 overall expenses \[Cost of Revenue 352,547 + Total operating expenses 1,913,805\]

Loss from Operations is (1,173,679)

Add back in total SBC of 1,270,702

= 97,023

When factoring in the smaller line items like interest income/expense and tax expense/benefits, it looks like Palantir made roughly 100MM excluding SBC.

The path to profitability is high growth rate that exceeds expense growth rate, but it's not clear.

If Palantir's revenue grows around 35%/year over the next 5 years, they are looking at revenues of 5 Billion... so the question then becomes: how fast will their overall expenses be growing?

I don't have an answer to this.

The Bull case is that Palantir continues to streamline product deployment through modular software and automation of their platform.  The Bear case is that every customer's needs are going to continue to be different, which hinders scalability because the company needs to keep growing its staff of FDEs (Forward Deployed Engineers).

An investment in PLTR is betting that the company will be able to solve the scalability problem, assuming that they also provide a better product than their competitors."

Not financial advice.

&gt;You need to be careful:  
$45 is 30x revenue (this is higher than TSLA, SNOW, PLTR valuation).  
They were priced at $8bn in Nov, now $30bn mkt caps?  
They sold $520m of series H funding or 12m shares in Jan 2021 so that they did not need to do the IPO's ""offering"" and go direct. What this means is they convinced &lt; 10 investors to pony up the funds for 12m shares at $45 that they can tell you the entire 652 million shares is all worth $45 also.With the IPO route, the bankers would have priced it at $15 and it doubles like AI, ABNB, DASH, so it'd be $30. But they are smart to tell you that it's worth $45, hoping you will pay $70/$80/$90. And if that happens, this stock will be more expensive than any stocks I know.  
Also, why Direct Listing? Because there will not be a lock up period of 180 days. Without it the investors can sell on day 1. But why does it matter? Because after covid, kids will go to school, spend time at pool parties, soccer games than playing. Guess what would happen to earnings and then stock price?  
What they did was brilliant. They did an IPO without and IPO. They got the IPO money with series H funding, then the DPO allowed them to sell on day 1 (using 12/652m shares or 1.8% of shares to pump the value of the company by 300%). They got a sky-high valuation, more than TSLA could. And in their words, they saved $1bn of banker fees. The only losers? I think maybe those who buy from their selling out.

No no no.

The 2239 loss is the loss for owning an equity worth zero that you paid 2350 for, taking into account the 111 you made on premium.

Lets say on the exercise date, PLTR is at a price of 16 due to some unforeseen circumstance. Your loss would be (2350-1600+111) or 639 dollars."

Fundamentals are not the only indicator of the stocks price. PLTR could spend 5 years in a demand bubble. Tesla has been in a demand bubble since before COVID. Its driven on rumour and potential rather than fundamentals.

Personally I think you have way too many similar funds with overlap and your individual stocks are not distinct enough from the ETFs you hold. 

Very underweight international/EM, energy, US financials which all have the ability to seriously outperform tech this year if the reopening rotation keeps happening.

So just by saying hey others did not compete with others so they won't compete with pltr is not a valid argument

Biggest data holder is google and facebook if this particular field becomes lucrative they won't stay put they will try to get a market share on this one.

2021-03-11 06:17:26,"The largest problem with your model is the gross margin assumption being far off. Palantir is aiming for 85%+ gross margins. They were talking about that on investor day. 

As for the price / sales your assumption is also low. It is not the case that a company growing this fast with this kind of margin gets a 20 PS. You should be thinking more like Shopify (SHOP). Companies that get low PS in software are mature like Google or FB. But they don‚Äôt have that kind of growth. You are showing a measly $7bn revenue which is a paltry portion of their TAM. 

You also should consider for pricing in long term growth the TAM will greatly increase. They are underpricing their product to gain monopoly power. They are seeking a technical monopoly as they are too far ahead, also to discourage new entrants right now with low pricing, and to ward off any anti trust pressure via low pricing. This will get them monopoly status and pricing power. Also data collection is always increasing at a fast pace. I‚Äôve seen TAM estimated at double that in five years. 

Based on these factors I‚Äôm seeing PLTR as positioned to be gigantic. Karp talks about it being the most important software company in the world in time and he is right. No business can compete and no government without an edge in data analysis and AI.

Never underestimate how much people are willing to spend on their pets!

I'm also investing on the assumption that I wont see green for 2 years if I invest in PLTR now."

I'm looking at a few big tech stocks atm, but am focusing on finding reasonable prices for PLTR just now tbh. The EPS at EOY2021 is probably going to be negative, but EOY2022 is my focus. The EPS projection is 1.29. Back-calculating that for 2021 and now makes me feel like the current price is actually somewhat reasonable, depending on what good P/E values are."

2021-03-11 00:28:41,"PLTR previous golden days near Christmas got massive negative media and multiple price downgrades all the way to $33. It kept testing but eventually traded to $23. Smart people cashed out. Now it rebounded on hype now went back to where it is because of Cathie buying. It actually is a disruptor. But idk media is sometimes right and wrong and I do think there is some influence that media has and maybe possible corruption. 

Is GME a disruptor? If yes it worth $20 billion dollars? If not is the price increase triggered by massive retail FOMO buying with their life savings or shorts covering? These are the questions to ask imo."

I luckily bailed on the way down around the 300 marker, above the break even of 224, but i don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm going to gamble at 260+. If by some miracle they go past old heights, then more power to them.

2021-03-10 21:55:09,"I agree that the software Salesforce offers is probably more universally in-demand, but not sure about ServiceNow. I have personal connections that work on the business side for ServiceNow so I have a little more insight on their operations. ServiceNow faces the same business difficulties Palantir willl have to overcome - how can a platform that was initially designed for a large entreprise be redesigned to cater toward small businesses? ServiceNow leverages third-party vendors to provide custom solutions, so it's possible Palantir goes down the same path. 

What makes me particularly excited about the stock (and I see this in my line of work) is that companies you wouldn't expect to be big data companies are in fact becoming big data companies. Traditional non-tech companies have accumulated pbs of data and are struggling to make sense of what all this data means. In ten to twenty years, what will distinguishes a company from its competitors are the insights they gain from the data.

Without delving too deep into Palantir's valuation, there's always a certain level of discomfort in investing in these high-growth tech companies, By definition, the high-growth is built into the price of the company. Who knows though? If Palantir faces reduced growth, it's possible pltr will be a 10 dollar stock in five years. On the flipside, if Palantir manages to leverage its expertise into locking down the big data market, I wouldn't be surprised to see it valued more than Salesforce in five to ten years."

Again, I'm not anti-PLTR, I'm just trying to grasp why this is a good call for possibly hitting $30+ per share. I'm just not seeing it. I think their value per share is about where they're at."

2021-03-10 17:04:08,"personally i'm more optimistic on apple right now than disney. 

disney is letting their politics interfere with business as they remove classic movies like dumbo and peter pan from their service (which in turn means it's probably only a matter of time until they black list the movies for bluray sales / park appearances / etc.). they're also removing people from high profile successful shows like carano on the mandalorian.

at some point, if they continue going down that route it's going to bite them in the ass. nostalgia is a powerful thing and disney is opting to throw the things people are nostalgic about in the trash while kneecapping their new content.

they're not going bankrupt or tanking any time soon, i just don't see room for massive growth above and beyond what they did this year. i picked up some shares this time last year, but don't have any plans to get more. 

aapl on the other hand while having the same politics isn't letting it interfere with their business. they'll continue to grow, and if anything comes from the ""apple car"", that stock is going to explode. (yes, i realize they probably won't ""make"" a car and will probably just partner with a company that does while providing self-driving and various other tech, but the point still stands)

as far as investing **now** goes, aapl is down a bit, while dis is at all time highs. timing wise, aapl is definitely a better pickup right now. of course, rather than going all in on one with what you go for, i'd probably put like 80% in there and then put 20% in something that isn't either of them but has the chance to grow much larger (like increasing your PLTR holdings, or grabbing SFT or something like that)"

in their Q4 earnings, PLTR estimated revenue to reach minimum 4 billion by 2025, which is about a 30% annual growth rate each year from 2021 to 2025. 

if the revenue growth rate were 45% each year, we would get 7 billion of revenue by 2025 (1.1b \* 1.45\^5). If the PS drops to  20, the market cap would only be 140 billion, indicating a 3.33 times increase. which is impressive, but seemed overhyped? i hope im wrong here haha.

2021-03-10 14:49:54,"PLTR is back on the menu !!"
2021-03-10 14:49:40,"Okay it might be difficult to convince you, but I'll try to defend my investment in Palantir. 

Palantir has a relatively small team of well-paid software engineers, and the jobs are highly sought after. I would argue that the likes of Amazon or Apple are much shittier in terms of treating their employees (warehouse/factory workers). 

I believe in 'disruptive tech', like PLTR, because I think we need it to save ourselves from falling into some stagnant and miserable economic state. I am not a big fan of big consumer product conglomerates or oil/gas companies, because I don't think they will eventually help us create a better world.

Palantir is well-equipped to help resolve some of the issues we're facing in the world. For instance, Palantir software helps companies measure and decrease their carbon footprint.

There was this scandal about PLTR's contract with ICE. Now, I think this is of course not the greatest thing it has done. But immigration has been a contentious issue in the US for decades, and no US admin has ever had an unconditional open border policy, even if they play lip service to it. 

I think Palantir is in a difficult spot, because one of its aims is to help democratically elected governments and will therefore not formulate its own ethical stance if said government is asking them to do something regarding defence/immigration. PLTR is in the executive branch as a company, not the policy making branch.

All of this is ethically debatable, but I think there isn't an ethically pure path. Everything we do involves some level of hypocrisy and we need to deal with that appropriately on a personal level.

If you take this question to the extreme it gets close to: 

is there ethical consumption/investment under capitalism? 

Well, maybe not completely, but the alternatives to some form of capitalism also don't have an amazing track record."

* PLTR has 1.47Bn shares outstanding, compared to snowflakes 220Mn.

* Snowflake has competition that PLTR doesn't have, thanks to its focus on cloud-based data storage over integrating into customer computer systems. 

* Snowflake also appears to go for the easy contracts while ignoring the whales. Basically the opposite of PLTR.

* Because of the previous 2 points, Snowflake will likely have higher initial revenue, but in a much more saturated market and competing against industry giant's like Google and Microsoft. This could hurt their revenue in the future. 

* PLTR has more experience and this seems to show. Before Snowflake was even an idea, PLTR were playing Minority Report for the US military in Afghanistan and Iraq."

OP explained their moat, at least partially, but didn't seem to realise they did it. PLTR works with big companies with huge and complicated data analysis needs. Implementing something that meets those needs can potentially take 6 months or more. The PLTR strategy is to target the biggest, most complicated customers and effectively install the software for free, only properly charging the customer once the software is up and running. This creates a niche in the market and a massive price barrier for competitors. Its also why PLTR is going to take a while for its revenue to get up to speed."

2021-03-10 08:52:39," Not financial advice.

&gt;You need to be careful:   
&gt;  
&gt;1) $45 is 30x revenue (this is higher than TSLA, SNOW, PLTR valuation).  
&gt;  
&gt; 2) They were priced at $8bn in Nov, now $30bn mkt caps?   
&gt;  
&gt;3) They sold $520m of series H funding or 12m shares in Jan 2021 so that they did not need to do the IPO's ""offering"" and go direct. What this means is they convinced &lt; 10 investors to pony up the funds for 12m shares at $45 that they can tell you the entire 652 million shares is all worth $45 also.  
&gt;  
&gt;With the IPO route, the bankers would have priced it at $15 and it doubles like AI, ABNB, DASH, so it'd be $30. But they are smart to tell you that it's worth $45, hoping you will pay $70/$80/$90. And if that happens, this stock will be more expensive than any stocks I know.  
&gt;  
&gt;Also, why Direct Listing? Because there will not be a lock up period of 180 days. Without it the investors can sell on day 1. But why does it matter? Because after covid, kids will go to school, spend time at pool parties, soccer games than playing. Guess what would happen to earnings and then stock price?  
&gt;  
&gt;What they did was brilliant. They did an IPO without and IPO. They got the IPO money with series H funding, then the DPO allowed them to sell on day 1 (using 12/652m shares or 1.8% of shares to pump the value of the company by 300%). They got a sky-high valuation, more than TSLA could. And in their words, they saved $1bn of banker fees. The only losers? I think maybe those who buy from their selling out.

PLTR is one I like and is being bunched in with ‚Äúmeme stocks‚Äù but it is a legitimate company with the possibility for a big edge.   
I saw someone else reccomend and I agree because it is for a kid the RBLX IPO tommorow would be a fun speculation - When/if they get bought out a few years down the line that would be some relatively easy money again with high upside.    
AAPL and DIS are two staples of my own portfolio so you really can‚Äôt go wrong there either - but upside is slightly more limited.   
Electric cars and technology might be a fun industry to consider. Avoid Tesla at all costs, but a little research into companies like Volkswagen or Toyota who are making big strides for electric vehicles in the next year or two offers some quality potential. Their stocks have historically been limited, but if Tesla is any example, if their electric cars are a huge hit their market caps could change drastically.

I‚Äôm thinking I‚Äôll roll the dice on a pltr yolo with the hope it gets at least 35% return by end of year to make up for the tax penalty (25% for difference in long vs short term gains, plus an extra 10% assuming that‚Äôs what the boring fund gains over the same time period).

If you just want to increase your risk profile but don't know what's going on then I think if you start allocating capital towards ARK funds which basically take the work load needed. Look into which ARK fund you like and allocate 25% of your account towards it or something.

If you want to be more hands on and be even riskier, you're going to have to just read a lot and look into tickers that come up and start picking your own stocks. Interestingly, most of these hype stocks like TSLA, PLTR, etc. are all already in the ARK funds so in the end, if you like a particular stock like TSLA over everything else then you could just allocate more money to TSLA than everything else vs. it being capped at 10% in an ARKK fund.

KO, is the largest player in a stagnant sector. Even if they invented New Coke (pun intended), they cannot move the needle.   
VZ might give you more bang for your buck, better dividend.

I personally have SO and D, good dividend... like KO and VZ, not big movers, but my cost basis is so low that my actual return is double digits...

&gt; Class A common stock, $0.0001 par value per share: 675,000,000 shares authorized, 144,039,488 shares issued and outstanding, actual; 4,935,000,000 shares authorized, 493,163,464 shares issued and outstanding, pro forma

&gt; Class B common stock, $0.0001 par value per share: 65,000,000 shares authorized, 57,287,302 issued and outstanding, actual and pro forma

Class A + B + preferred stock **issued** = 144,039,488 + 57,287,302  + 337,235,090 = 538.5M shares
Class A + B + preferred **Authorized** = 4.935B + 65M  + 349.5M (I missed this number in my first look) = 5.35B shares

Like come on folks. You'll be lucky to see most tech trade sideways for the next year or two. Company evaluations STILL matter, and when something is trading at a stupidly high P/S or P/E (Looking at you, PLTR), its due for a correction. Long term evaluation matters too, but my god doubling your market cap without significantly increasing revenue/earnings is just a recipe for disappointment.

Always do a quick glance over current and future estimates of P/S, P/E, PEG. Just because a company is going to perform stellar in the future does not mean its current evaluation is attractive for investments."

What you see is one thing in demos. The company is real life minority report. Elon Musk has some really interesting perspectives about this, because it is basically AI. (referring to the dangers of AI being evil or used for evil purposes) Remember, the queries that go in are interpreted by software written by humans. And that engineer's code determines the level of morality of human vs AI... Some people think it is great I find it scary as fuck. And the fact that they did NOT find BIN LADEN leads me to believe it isnt really that great......If you have any questions regardirng Bin Laden, pls research Benazir Bhutto and how it was Omar Sheik that killed Bin Laden. Which further convinces me we are in a big psyop... But it takes a shit ton of critical thinking to evaluate it all. And few are okay with questioning everything. But I will leave you with one bit to look at. 
If you know anything about kidney failure and Bin laden was in END STAGE kidney failure in 01 you know that you cabbot live without dialysis 3-4 times a week.
The compound where (body double) was killed had no dialysis machines in it and NOWHERE near any place to get dialysis 3-4x a week.
You cannot live for more than a week or so off dialysis because you will die from the buildup in your blood. Start there in your research. Because THIS is WHAT PLTR touts as their big victory.
Iran knew it was a body double and Bin Laden was killed by Omar Sheik.
It is a really crazy rabbit hole. Put it together.

I've been taking advantage of the high IV by going long on growth stocks that I like and then selling weekly way OTM covered calls. Finding that I can sell a CC on a meme stock with a strike price 25% OTM and still get a hefty premium. I like these stocks so I'm okay with the volatility on the underline security and those weekly CCs are great cash flow. I also don't care if it gets assigned. I'm selling CCs 25% OTM so if it gets assigned I made 25% on the security in one week + the CC premium. If I still like the security I'll just do weekly Cash Covered Puts until it gets assigned as a way to again benefit from the volatility and hopefully buy it at a low.

2021-03-09 13:37:39,"At the end of the day ago cares what anyone says or thinks, investment strategies are unique there isn't one way, there are guidelines and formulas that CAN help but aren't guaranteed. The market is fluid, unpredictable and 100% a gamble or risk regardless what data and analysts say or advise. (See Warren Buffet interviews for confirmation) 

You can make every right technical / fundemental move and lose money or every wrong one and kill it.

My advice which is worth about as much as PLTR calls, browse Investing, ThetaGang,WSB, Options etc. Read or watch the news regularly and invest in what makes you excited or you believe in."
2021-03-09 13:35:24,"Buying more PLTR unless it spikes up.  The valuation right now is amazing"
2021-03-09 13:34:46,"One word of advice. If someone posts it on youtube, it's too late. If someone has to say ""This is not financial advise."" Then they're either telling you to get in for a PnD, or they're wanting to pump the stock to get out of their position.   


If I was you, i would look at stocks that have a very steady value. ie, their beta is close to 1. That way, you're not just gambling. Cause right now, I'd say that you should put your money in ETFs and only invest in stocks with dividends because if you aren't researching the shit out of any companies, then you're pretty much gambling.   


For the most part, Cannabis companies may grow, but look at any company and their finances are garbage. I can't find one company that has good finances that is in the weed business.   


That's my advice because if you're a beginner, get out of anything that is BB/AMC/GME/PLTR/Weed/EV/NIO/TSLA. Don't buy anything at the ATH. Just don't. There's always pullback."

Over 50 is when he should be less aggressive, not buying PLTR thats market cap makes 0 sense. If this tech death thing stops soon, he might be okay. If not, he can kiss money from the memes goodbye, potentially forever.

Maybe have him do something a lot safer. Maybe some indexes. At his age, he can't be YOLOing on speculative picks."

Sir_jack_alot missed the PLTR run-up from 23-40 through trying to time the dip and missed out on literal millions.

The jump in GME is going to be much more violent if the squeeze happens and if I‚Äôd miss it I‚Äôd never be able to forgive myself."

Sorry can‚Äôt throw life savings away, but maybe with time I‚Äôll be convinced to ü§™. Started out rough, too emotional, missing every low and FOMOing in high. Took my 3k and made it 2k quick. 

So there I was holding 2 GME at 150, some PLTR üôÑ, SENS, and more. Then it happened. saw GME creep back above 50 and got a feeling. Pulled almost everything out for a loss to get some GME, averaged to 20 at $70. 

Whatever happens, even if I never meet my goal, it‚Äôs been so fun on this journey finding this sub. Whatever people say, I love us apes. We‚Äôre doing some crazy things INDIVIDUALLY OF COURSE SEC, and I like the stock."

2021-03-09 10:01:00,"Lots of talk about meme stocks. With those you can win hard but also lose hard. In January, illegal shenanigans happened, many people missed the exit point and became bag holders. Some of those are green again now, others are not. GameStop is a unique situation, all those new squeeze plays are super dangerous.

Over the last few weeks, growth and tech stocks were getting butchered. The rebound should be as massive as the pullback, so those might give you a head start. Hot ones are, among others, PLTR, ROKU, SKLZ. Personally, I would probably buy growth now and set a limit of 50‚Äì100% gain to sell half and put it into safer investments. Or put all in ARK ETFs, because the are into growth but know better than you or me how to rotate.

Half-meme stocks that might be an idea: BB and PLTR (already mentioned but fits here).

Note that I have not been investing for very long and you generally should not trust anyone pumping any stock. I have a position in PLTR and BB and still thinking about the other ones."

Currently its trading at ~44x P/S for 2020, and based on 4B revenue in 2025, that would pin them at ~12.5x P/S for 2025. I understand they have a high profit margin, but even taking that into account the valuation still makes no sense. Assume they achieve a net profit margin of 50% (frankly, insane), that would be earnings of 2B on 4B revenue in 2025, or a P/E of 22x. Assuming you were looking for the stock to double by 2025, that would further peg them at 44x P/E. None of the FAANG companies have ever traded higher than 20x P/S in their entirety, and they are arguably the highest growth stocks ever. FAANG P/E ratios are all over the place based on profit margins, but AAPL being the highest of the bunch never traded above 35x, and that was before the 08 crash.

Just looking for some opinions on this and what I might be missing, but the financial valuations of PLTR look to be extremely disconnected to its future prospects."

Here is something from wikipedia
The company is known for three projects in particular: Palantir Gotham, Palantir Metropolis, and Palantir Foundry. Palantir Gotham is used by counter-terrorism analysts at offices in the United States Intelligence Community (USIC) and United States Department of Defense.[6] In the past, Gotham was used by fraud investigators at the Recovery Accountability and Transparency Board, a former US federal agency which operated from 2009 to 2015. Gotham was also used by cyber analysts at Information Warfare Monitor, a Canadian public-private venture which operated from 2003 to 2012. Palantir Metropolis is used by hedge funds, banks, and financial services firms.[7][8] Palantir Foundry is used by corporate clients such as Morgan Stanley, Merck KGaA, Airbus, and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV.[9]"

2021-03-08 19:34:21,"Pltr is trade at an absurd value and the only thing pltr had was earning growth surprise. A company in a bullish sector can trade at much higher than actual annual growth due to the surprise element. But the CEO fked that up by saying 30% growth for 5 years that killed the stock. 

Also floor doesn't have such a high range., might as well say floor is $0 to 23

Floor = 22.9 give or take 3 to 4% 

Or 

Floor is mid to high 22

PLTR is a speculative and risky buy.. but you might not understand the value they provide in big data analysis...

all that said.. no disputing that AAPL is a heavy weight fighter... and PLTR an underdog lightweight... but that said... growth potential for PLTR is quite large... its a small company that can grow ... that ""should"" have an accelerating effect..

2021-03-08 19:18:40,"&gt;a stock should not double unless some income also basically doubles

What? You must be new to investing if that's what you think , share price reflect the future value and potential to create more value of a company generally not the other way around  and aapl was trading at a huge discount.
Also stock barely trade at a fair value , they are mostly trading under or over the actual value.

I can't believe what I'm reading.  There are a billion factored into Share price,  if it was a simple oh this company makes this much so this is how much it worth  there wouldn't be hundreds of thousands of analysts getting paid 6 figure to analyze a company to the bone.

Both aapl and pltr are over value but if you had to compare aapl vs pltr only , aapl looks fking cheap AF .

Aapl is trading at 32 p.e and forward p.e  of high 20s

What's the forward p.e for pltr ?

An undervalue stock has a easier time to double and become overvalued than an overvalued stock to double to become-out-of-this-universe-valued stock regardless of market cap.

Aapl is a very bad if not the worse stock to use in your case.

Try another stock."

That was the first day that current and former employees could cash out all of their shares after the company went public.

I‚Äôve broken even on GME CC‚Äôs I think, and I‚Äôm profitable scaling into my PLTR short call positions in the am and then selling out during the inevitable crash. If it goes against me, I buy back by eod and eat the L. I know PLTR‚Äôs behavior though. GME is unpredictable so no more CC‚Äôs for me it‚Äôs not worth it. If it think it‚Äôs gonna fall I‚Äôll just sell."

I play covered calls on stocks I like (besides GME, we like the stock).  AMD, ETSY, ARKK, PINS, PLTR, TQQQ, NET, SQ.  I try to make 10-20% annulized on my covered calls so is boring but has made me some good gains."

I prefer day trading CC‚Äôs as opposed to letting theta do the work after I had my PLUG shares called away during their insane runup (my cost average was $9). Plus most of my money was made during insane unforeseen rally‚Äôs so I don‚Äôt want to be short calls going into that. To each his own tho.

So for around 1000 bucks you can pick up a contract for 100 shares at like 25 strike or something.

There's more risk than shares outright. But if you think it's going to be higher than 35/share in a year (25 + 10 premium) if it's at like 60 in a year, you can exercise if you want those shares or sell the contract for the IV.

2021-03-08 02:30:38,"I wouldn‚Äôt say this is ‚Äúexplained slightly better‚Äù but you did decent. You forgot to mention a few things though...

Palantir specializes in deepfuckingdata analyses mainly for governmental clients. what does that mean? It means, for example, that to get detailed info on someone, all you would need is a name and license plate number and Palantir does the rest. It performs a deep search of all criminal, financial, medical, communication, and clandestine agency records on the target. 

The company‚Äôs tech helped locate Osama bin fucking Laden in 2011 and is being used to trace COVID-19 infections, track medical supply chains, and even predict outbreaks in pandemic hot zones. Think of the company as a search engine for deep analysis of petabytes (or millions of gigabytes) of data. 

You ALSO FORGOT to mention Cathy Wood AKA the MF MONEY TREE just LOADED up on PLTR during this dip. She bought damn near 10 million shares.

2021-03-08 02:24:47,"In your analogy the only way Palantir can give you a proper answer is if they already programmed the alternative options and used the algorithm to optimize for the best outcome. It's not magic, it's not groundbreaking, it's just fking enterprise software using statistics and bunch of other algorithms to get you the answer. Plenty of enterprise software companies do that. 

The reason to invest in PLTR is because of the portfolio of clients Palantir is amassing and the momentum they have. This software is a pain in the ass to replace. Buyers put their reputations on the line when they select Palantir. The high switching costs make this a great business in the long run."

PLTR is the opposite in that regard. Market cap of over $40B on a $1B revs company, RSI in the mid-40s, and its essentially a meme stock.
