gr4u8f8;Sciencetist;1;"&gt; Umm were you in a comma when trading was halted by SEC because of volatility several times that day (3/10 

You realize that the stock was up over 700% from when the gamma squeeze began at that point, right? What does a stock halt prove? The same thing happened in the TLRY squeeze of January 2018 when the stock went to $300, collapsed to $180, and ended the day around $220, IIRC.

It also sounds to me like you don't really understand volatility halt. This happens to literally *every* stock if it rises/drops a lot in a very short time. It's not evidence of manipulation -- it's literally the stock market performing as intended.

I've been in it since it was sub $10 and have taken some profits. Nothing HUGE because I wanted to see where it was going, but I'm kind of liking how things are looking pre-tlry merger. 

I know APHA likely doesn't NEED tlry from the way things look...but hear me out. I know big tobacco has been planning for this day to come. If these small companies want to survive and control market share once weed is legalized...they're really going to need as much capital and credit as they can get their hands on.

I foresee Apple-like lawsuits about everything from packaging to manufacturing processes to biological IP for cultivation and even plant genetics. The corn industry and tobacco are two prime examples of how big subsidized corps can drive out smaller companies.

This is one of the main reasons I'm personally interested in seeing the merger go through.

You actually have no evidence of anything they are accusing TLRY of. You have no leads or findings. Nothing has been announced other than the lawsuits. You are arguing from a baseless stance. If there really was criminal activity and they wanted to win, they would involve the SEC to give their suite merit. If the SEC finds wrong doing, the lawsuits would be a slam dunk. The fact that the SEC announced nothing shows they are just trying to get suckers, like yourself, to buy into it. They didn't even say they were working with the SEC. I assume you are one of the suckers because you are defending the baseless claims so hard.

Also, comparing a corrupt cop with no evidence making a claim in this situation would make the lawyers the corrupt cop. A fact less claim with no evidence that they don't want the SEC to investigate.";stocks;2021-03-13 15:36:38

And for that, i really love reddit compared to just investing in a stock based on something i heard on tv which has nobody critiquing it. The comments sections tend to be a good way to decide if a DD is worth following or not (although not in gamestops case. Everyone picked apart DFV for an entire year on his DD)
So since early November almost all the stocks i put on my watchlist because of DD i saw on reddit either took off or had small gains. The steel stocks are just starting to take off right now, they were like the only ones still in the red up until like a week ago.

gqruhkp;anonkraken;1;"Yes. Why? Catalysts. And I don’t give a fuck if they actually mean anything for revenue as bears have pointed out. This market runs on news... and weed is experiencing some historic news.

1) National Legalization: This is happening all over. We just had Mexico pass legislation and efforts are now moving in several big countries in Europe like Germany. Not to mention the Macdaddy bong rippers of all; the US. There will even be mini catalysts along the way as the legislation  passes various milestones in the process. TLRY/APHA have a presence in all of these markets.

2) State Legalization: States are legalization at a faster pace in non-conventional places. There’s nearly a 100% chance that NY, NM and MN will legalize in the coming months. Even if TLRY/APHA is a Canadian company and “there are US companies” as the bears say, it’s the biggest in the world, and it’s shares will gain from positive US news.

3) The merger: as mentioned, the APHA merger will make the combined group the largest weed company in the world. APHA owns Sweetwater Brewing out of GA and will leverage that massive distribution network to enter the US market quickly when the time comes.

gqpfumf;shad0wtig3r;1;"https://www.wsj.com/articles/aphria-and-tilray-to-merge-to-create-biggest-global-cannabis-company-11608137481

&gt;Two Canadian cannabis companies have agreed to merge, creating what they said would be the largest cannabis operation globally by revenue and potentially signaling more deals ahead among cannabis firms.

&gt;Aphria Inc. APHA -0.23% and Tilray Inc. TLRY -2.15% said Wednesday their proposed combination would create a company with annual revenue on a pro-forma basis of Canadian $874 million, equivalent to $686 million. The combined company would control 17% of the adult-use Canadian cannabis market by revenue, according to Raymond James, roughly double the shares of three other competitors.

It's close for sure, but at $686 MILLION it's widely reported they will be bigger via revenue period. Look MSOs have been lagging I'm in literally every MSO and other player with actual substance. But my gains on the Canadian players are WAY larger. 

And the merger will dominate attention for a long time. Biden hasn't done shit with decriminalization, he could have signed an EO on DAY ONE, and it's hurting MSOs as they need to get on major exchanges, until then they will not have the returns of the Canadian players.";stocks;2021-03-12 16:46:28

- Shareholders vote for merger in mid-April. If it gets approved then we’re most likely looking at May. 

- 100% correct on arbitrage; however, look at the options chain. There are FAR more options being traded on TLRY that is pushing the price up. Price discrepancy here can be viewed as the visual difference of the option interest / volume. 

- When it comes to mergers, option traders on the company that is merging into the other decreases (APHA). This is because there’s risk for call buyers holding through the date due to the Adjustments on existing contracts.";stocks;2021-03-12 02:49:56

Also, as a heads up, your option details will adjust due to all the conversions. From what I found on the SEC site, they will adjust the number of underlying shares each contract represents and the Strike price. Done by multiplying and dividing them by the Exchange Rate.   


Exchange Rate: .8381

Shares Adjustment:  
Pre-Merger: 1 Contract of APHA = 100 APHA Shares   
Post-Merger: 1 Contract of TLRY = 83.81 TLRY Shares  


Strike Price Adjustment:

gqmhhum;Threads-by-Tones;1;"If you have an idea of what you think these will sell for, set a day limit so that it sells WHEN it hits a price you like vs. waiting till 3PM and seeing what it is and if there are any buyers in that last hour of the trading day (and your options contract life).

If you have *some* idea as to what you think the underlying stocks' prices will hit, then you can use that to back in to what your sell target on your options might be - and set your limit against that.

I don't know what you paid for your options or when you bought them, what the underlying stock price was at the time, etc. but take a look at this example: [http://opcalc.com/rjO](http://opcalc.com/rjO)

\^\^ That's TLRY, the 3/12 option at $25 strike. According to this chart, if TLRY hits $29 tomorrow, that means your contract should be worth about $4, whereas I'm guessing you originally paid something like $1.75, so your profit is $2.25 per stock *if someone buys it from you.* Short story, if you think it'll hit $29, set your sell limit to $4 for the day (TLRY example).

gqm2ojh;TheFondestComb;0;Let’s clear some things up, I never said there was a single cartel, only local ones, and that’s true. Cartels are not worth that $500 million figure that Trumps shoe licker and ex-senator Purdue likes to claim. Most estimates place the entire combined cartels worth at between $6 and $29 billion. That’s closer to a single company like TLRY, especially if that trillion dollar market cap comes to fruition. Cartels are only successful because they have no real resistance, the Mexican military is a joke and doesn’t try against them, as most have bought off Mexican officials and when they do clash its always with a much smaller national guard force than is estimated to be needed. Big weed companies with more money can buy them out harder. Finally as you said, it isn’t one cartel yet you expect them to all act as one and behead staff when that staff would understandably be armed as well. Government backed corporations would squish the cartels underneath their shoes. Just look what happened with the logging industry, major money came into the region and bought out the cartels, now you have cartels that are basically full time loggers for these corporations. Still illegal but no longer as deadly as they only fight when they are targeted by others wanting to get in on the logging boom (it’s a thing just like the avocados). That could happen with weed as well. Individual companies buying out their local cartels for protection and using them as cheap labor. Eventually the turn to employees and if done right, the major cartels are bought up or forced out by their peers and stop pushing into each other’s territory which ends most of the shit to begin with. It’s not pretty but the cartels even combined, aren’t even close to being able to compete if someone like MO wanted to set up shop.;wallstreetbets;2021-03-11 20:25:15

gqjg6lh;TheFondestComb;1;"There’s way more to be made in weed than in avocados. There’s also going to be a point in time where weed is legal in the states which would cause Mexican cartels to refocus and lose a large driving part of their profits. Mexico just having legal weed in general will surround the US with legal weed and it will be pouring across the boarder. 

Additionally the legal weed sector could be worth close to $1 trillion in the coming decade, compare that to the cartels that bring in an estimated combined $9-23 billion. That much money is sure to attract private businesses, businesses with a bit more defense than avocado farms. Not saying that will solve anything but TLRY bringing in private security for their farms or labs would definitely cause some to think twice.  They could also just straight up buy out individual cartels and make them be their security arm in the region.

I'm much more optimistic about CGC or TLRY as they both have institutional investors already and large insider holdings. Yet take a look at SNDL, 1.6% held by insiders?

gqb4bwk;epicguest321;1;"this sounds actually retarded, but ever since i started trading i literally treat my money in robinhood like a mobile game. 

If you're investing, then just let your money chill there or buy some ETF's.

But this is wsb. We don't do that here.

Also don't take investing advice from someone without doing any research whatsoever. Read up, do research (due diligence), learn how to play market sentiment and look at a company's fundamentals, etc. Don't give a shit about ""technicals"" because it's astrology for men. fuck that.

When incurring a loss, there's always something to learn. I went from 1.3k to 30k back down to 2k from the whole gamestop drama during January, and I learned that it is indeed okay to sell and trim profits as we moon.

Treat it all as a learning experience. that's all. 

""oh shit! i made 5k off of some TLRY calls. so, what did i do right and how can i use this information for my next trade? well, i made sure to sell once my calls hit a certain % gain and didn't get greedy with it. Good job, me! time to delete the ticker off of my watch list and go onto the next trade.""

""Oh, shit. I'm down 80% on a $DIS earnings play. Let me figure out why my options decayed in value so significantly even though the stock price went up after earnings. fuck. apparently options plays for earnings are really risky because the options' premiums already price in the massive increase or decrease in value per share of the stock."" 

These 2 examples above are real life examples. Made a few grand off of tlry calls, bought some pre-earnings $dis calls and got absolutely raped by IV. It was that day that I realized that selling cc's and csp's (covered calls and cash secured puts) was a decent strategy for playing a company's earnings call.

When i got destroyed on the $dis calls, i fucked off of RH for a week and played some videogames and focused more on my college classes. I came back with a new mentality (not a rage-betting full tilt mentality).

I know that we also don't like to learn here, but yeah, just some tips for you.";wallstreetbets;2021-03-09 08:35:57
gqazdwi;big-rey;1;"Reading some of your rules. This what I would do, and I know I'll get downvoted, but IMO it's the move. 

You said you aren't liable for losses and get to keep the winnings, so I would buy a LEAP on a decently affordable good company, or an upside play. It's hard to grow 500$ on straight shares, a 10% return is a good year and that's only 50$.

So if your LEAP prints, you win. If you lose, you lose all 500, but you aren't liable for the loss, so it doesn't matter.

To put it in perspective I bought 1 8C LEAP on TLRY last year for 150$ and it is currently worth 1,540 (it was worth way more a few weeks ago lol).

Good luck and have fun! Hope you learn a lot.";stocks;2021-03-09 07:19:00
